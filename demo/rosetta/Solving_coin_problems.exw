--      [INCOMPLETE/NOT POSTED/NOT DISTRIBUTED]
--
--  This is tagged as an "Excessively difficult task".
--  I suppose it could/should be simplified by separating 
--          1) english -> equations
--  and
--          2) solve equations.
--  Some thoughts:
--      As far as rosettacode is concerned, generalised natural language processing is right up there
--      with voice recognition, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Anything which solves
--      some limited set of problems but is otherwise set in stone is pretty much useless. If however
--      it could function off a very limited set/table of rules that could be extended fairly easily 
--      at run-time might be useful. Failing that it should at least show you the equations it has
--      deduced, and if you don't like them it should allow you to override them and pass something
--      completely different to part two.
--
--      Personally speaking, I find that the approach of invoking some third party application to 
--      "do the dirty work", such as invoking maxima/imagemagic/etc just annoys me, however I have
--      to concede that as long as you could edit/retry the maxima script, it would be valid here.
--
-- I remember some kind of generalized triangle puzzle solver that I'd like to see again...
-- Ah, truth table (ugly and poor vs not rich and handsome)...

First stab at english -> equations. The latter can/should be stored as some kind of structure(s) rather than plain text.
(I will concede, not that I personally like it very much, that a maxima script as output is in fact perfectly valid.)
Possibly quite unnecessary, I have added a special operator, <=>, such that "2*dimes <=> nickels" has exactly the same
meaning as "2*nickels = dimes", to keep in line with the english word order, feel free to ignore if that does not help.


If a person has three times as many quarters as dimes and the total amount of money is $5.95, find the number of quarters and dimes.
                3       *           quarters <=>dimes,        total       =              595 
==>solve([q, d],[q = 3 * d, 595 = q * 25 + d * 10]); --> q=21, n=7

A pile of 18 coins consists of pennies and nickels. If the total amount of the coins is 38Â¢, find the number of pennies and nickels.
          18         =         pennies  +  nickels,        total  =                     38
==>solve([38 = n * 5 + p * 1, 18 = n + p], [n, p]); --> n = 5, p = 13

A small child has 6 more quarters than nickels. If the total amount of coins is $3.00, find the number of nickels and quarters the child has.
                  6   +  quarters  <=> nickels,        total        =             300
==>solve([q = n + 6, 300 = q * 25 + n * 5], [q, n]); --> q = 11, n = 5

A child's bank contains 32 coins consisting of nickels and quarters. If the total amount of money is $3.80, find the number of nickels and quarters in the bank.
                        32        =            nickels  +  quarters,        total        =             380
==>solve([380 = q * 25 + n * 5, 32 = q + n], [q, n]); --> q = 11, n = 21

A person has twice as many dimes as she has pennies and three more nickels than pennies. If the total amount of the coins is $1.97, find the numbers of each type of coin the person has.
               2*          dimes    <=>     pennies,      3    +   nickels  <=> pennies,        total          =               197

In a bank, there are three times as many quarters as half dollars and 6 more dimes than half dollars. If the total amount of the money in the bank is $4.65, find the number of each type of coin in the bank.
                        3    *           quarters <=>half_dollars,    6   +  dimes <=>  half_dollars,        total                =                     465
==>solve([q = 3 * h, d = h + 6, 465 = h * 50 + q * 25 + d * 10], [h, q, d]); --> h = 3, q = 9, d = 9

A person bought 12 stamps consisting of 37c stamps and 23c stamps. If the cost of the stamps is $3.74, find the number of each type of the stamps purchased.
                12            =         s @ 37      +  t @ 23,          total         =           374
==>solve([374 = s * 37 + t * 23, 12 = s + t], [s, t]); --> solution: s = 7, t = 5

A dairy store sold a total of 80 sandwiches and bars. If the sandwiches cost $0.69 each and the bars cost $0.75 each and the store made $58.08, find the number of each sold.
                              80  = s        +   b,              s        @     69,               b   @      75,                  total = 5808
==>solve([5880 = s * 69 + b * 75, 80 = s + b], [s, b]); --> solution: s = 20, b = 60
#Ambiguous. I first read the original as costs being < selling price, with some unknown markup on each, with the $58.08 being profit, as in takings-costs...
#One of an almost infinite number of possible solutions would therefore be: sell 79 sandwiches at $0.69 and 1 bar at $58.83.
#A dairy store sold a total of 80 sandwiches and bars. If the sandwiches were sold at $0.69 each and the bars were sold at $0.75 each and the store took $58.08, find the number of each sold.

Your uncle walks in, jingling the coins in his pocket. He grins at you and tells you that you can have all the coins if you can figure out how many of each kind of coin he is carrying. 
You're not too interested until he tells you that he's been collecting those gold-tone one-dollar coins. 
The twenty-six coins in his pocket are all dollars and quarters, and they add up to seventeen dollars in value. How many of each coin does he have?

You're not too interested until he tells you that he's been collecting those gold-tone one-dollar coins. The twenty-six coins in his pocket are all dollars and quarters, and they add up to seventeen dollars in value. How many of each coin does he have?
