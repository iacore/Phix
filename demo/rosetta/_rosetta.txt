
Obviously I am sticking to actual tasks, and avoiding any "problems" of the form:

    Demonstrate how to dynamically apply reflection to associate an arbitrary property 
    with an arbitrary attribute on a recursively defined abstract class hierarchy.
    Demonstrate how to instantiate such a pattern using a concrete invariant.

Because, of course, there is a limit to how much meaningless drivel I can actually take...
