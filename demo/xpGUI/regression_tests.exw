-- regression_tests.exw
-- ====================
--
--  The plan is to run all demo\xpGUI\rt\rt*.exw in turn (reporting any with non-0 result codes), such that both bUseGTK() 
--  and non-bUseGTK() are covered [on Windows anyway], possibly via ipc.
--  The gSetBodge() routine is a natural starting point. At least one should override such, invoke gSetAttribute(xxx,"SIZE")
--  and then gRedraw(). Each rt*.exw should terminate after some small fraction of a second, which could be on a timer or 
--  it might be even cooler were this program (able) to send keyboard/mouse input, also possibly via ipc. 
--
--  It does not really want to be part of p -test but it c/should perhaps be part of the packaging process (phixzip.exw).
