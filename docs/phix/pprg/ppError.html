<h2>Print Preview and Report Generator</h2>
<h3>Error Messages</h3></p>
<p><hr><p>
<p>
The following table only list a few unusual messages, not trival messages like "bad format".<br>
There are of course several more cryptic messages not listed here which occur when an internal
error occurs in the software; these should be reported as bugs.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Layout is stamped(see manual). Continue?
    <td>(Warning when attempting to amend a report layout).
        The layout has been <a href="ppLicence.html#Stamping">stamped</a> so
        that it can be distributed free of charge and used free of charge. However if 
        the report is amended, the report will need to be licenced to remove the 
        "UNREGISTERED SOFTWARE" watermark.
<tr><th>Mixed paper sizes not supported.
    <td>A report may not contain more than one paper size. This can only happen
        when several pages have been stitched together via the pageSequenceHook() routine,
        as shown in the booklet print example in pptest.exw. Portrait and Landscape
        layouts may be mixed, provided they are on the same paper size.
<tr><th>illegal summation on repeat field
    <td>Only type 's' (section) subtotals may be repeated on a page. It makes no sense to
        print carried forward, brought forward, page, final, or section page numbers 
        more than once on a page. If you want to, insert two copies of the field.
<tr><th>Print not allowed in Screen mode
    <td>See <a href="ppRef.html#Zoom">The Zoom Window</a>. When Screen is checked, the
        report details are fitted height and width to the display window. This is not a 
        valid paper size and therefore cannot be printed.
<tr><th>Unexpected printer resolution error
    <td>The size of A4 portrait does not appear to be 210mm by 297mm. This is either an
        error in the report subroutines or a printer setup error/corruption.
        Please report this to the author.
<tr><th>Printer unavailable
    <td>Try rebooting the computer. Some other program may not be releasing the printer
        correctly. Let me know if it occurs often.
<tr><th>Incorrect record length for record XX
    <td>The contents of datadict.txt do not agree with the datastream contents.
        Verify the length of each record in the datastream creation program as suggested 
        <a href="ppOver.html#Datastream">here</a>.
<tr><th>unmatched repeat depths.
    <td>The report generator believes you have specified that one field should be printed
        say 8 times per page, and another field from the same record say 10 times.
        Check the Repeat values on all fields. It may also be a mistake on a calculated 
        field, referencing the wrong record perhaps.
<tr><th>record xx not in alphabetic sequence at line nn
    <td>Records in datadict.txt must be defined in alphabetic order.
        This helps prevent accidentally reusing a two-character code already in use.
<tr><th>more/fewer format qualifiers than fields
    <td>The Format and Fields do not match. Cancel field entry/amendment and try again.
<tr><th>field list mishap, please check
    <td>The automatic insertion of a field qualifer or a field name in the field list has 
        noticed a problem. This can occur after manually editing the fields list, leaving 
        the cursor in an unexpected position. Cancel field entry/amendment and try again.
<tr><th>missing operator?, please check
    <td>The automatic insertion of a field name into the calculation expression could not
        find an appropriate bracket, comma, or operator (+-/* etc) at the field insertion
        point. It has placed a question mark where it believes the missing operator should
        go.
</table>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The following errors also occur during validation and evaluation of calculated fields:
<p>
<table>
<tr><td>unrecognised escape sequence
<tr><td>string in single quotes
<tr><td>fact() error
<tr><td>syntax error
<tr><td>mismatching sequence lengths
<tr><td>division by zero
<tr><td>length of atom is undefined
<tr><td>type mismatch, sequence expected
<tr><td>ordinal() error
<tr><td>type mismatch, integer expected
<tr><td>mismatching sequence lengths
<tr><td>bracket mismatch
<tr><td>attempt to slice an atom
<tr><td>index out of bounds
<tr><td>non-integer subscript
<tr><td>attempt to subscript an atom
<tr><td>missing right parenthesis
<tr><td>missing operator
<tr><td>unbalanced right parenthesis
<tr><td>invalid function argument
<tr><td>ambiguous add parenthesis
<tr><td>Circular reference
</table>
<p>
Let me know if there is any additional information you would find useful to be displayed
when one of the above errors occurs.
