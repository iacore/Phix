<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3></p>
<p><hr><p>
<p>
<a name=printerDC></a>
<ol class="n">
<li>Error: printerDC is undefined.
    <ol class="ua">
    <p>
    <li>This must be made global in win32lib.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>There's a bug in win32591.ew.
    <ol class="ua">
    <p>
    <li>Throw the file win32591.ew away, get a proper copy of win32lib, and make
    sure printerDC is global.<br>
    Follow this link for an <a href=ppInstall.html#win32591>explanation</a>.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Why can't I use calculations in the field list, eg:
<pre>
        Amount Due %8.2f

        {OHnet+OHvat}
</pre>
    Instead I have to use {%due} and define the calculated field separately?
    <ol class="ua">
    <p>
    <li>As a counter example,<p>
<pre>
        Vat %8.2f

        {((OIgross=0)*OInet*0.175+(OIgross!=0)*(OIgross-floor(OIgross/1.175)))/100}
</pre>
        cannot be elegantly displayed in the layout editor.<br>
        Note that such calculations are usually far easier to code in the datastream
        creation program, eg:
<pre>
            if OIgross=0 then
                OIvat=OInet*0.175
            else
                OIvat=floor(OIgross-OIgross/1.175)
            end if
            OIvat/=100  -- assuming OInet and OIgross are held in pennies/cents.
</pre>
        Then just print OIvat on the report.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>Why is there is no conditional in calculated fields?
    <p>
    <ol class="ua">
    <li>Whenever possible, complex calculations should be performed in the datastream
        creation program.
<p>
        See also the answers to the next two questions.
    </ol>
<p>
<a name=appfunc></a>
<li>Can I use a loop, or temporary local variables in a calculation?
<p>
    <ol class="ua">
    <li>No. It is however possible to define application-specific functions that can 
        be called within a calculation. The function must be called with one parameter,
        which can of course be a sequence of all the required fields. It should be 
        possible to pass a unique identifier, for example the order number, and then
        manually re-fetch any other data needed.<p>
        A simple example of such a function can be found in userfunc.ew.<p>
    </ol>
<p>
<a name=optional>
<li>How do I make a field optional?
<p>
    <ol class="ua">
    <li>To print an item only on the first sheet of a section (eg a multi-sheet invoice), 
    define it as Repeat 1, the default. 
    To make it print on all sheets, enter zero or blank in the Repeat field.<p>
    To print something on the last page of a section, put it on a separate record and 
    include that in the datastream at the end of the section.<p>
    To make an individual field conditionally blank either write it to the datastream as
    blank or use eg:
    <pre>
        OIdesc[1..length(OIdesc)*(OItype='x')]</pre>
    So when OItype is equal to 'x', it prints the full length, otherwise it prints "".
    <p>
    Another favourite trick, which works well with summations, is to use sprintf, for 
    example:<p>
    <pre>
        sprintf("Order total",{@sOIqtyOH})</pre>
    This works because the expression is not evaluated at all until the summation is 
    complete, and is cancelled if the summation is cancelled, and then the subtotal
    itself is not put in the text because there is no format for it. This is used on 
    the example invoice print so that "Brought forward" and "Carried forward" are
    only printed when the corresponding subtotal is also going to be printed.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>What is a section?
<p>
    <ol class="ua">
    <li>In datastream terms, a particular record (eg OH) and all records following it
    until the next record of that type.<p>
    In physical terms, for example, a customer invoice, which may normally be a single
    page but occasionally several. There may also be several sections on a single page.<p>
    In layout definition terms, they are abstract, except for the use of the 
    record type as the last part of <a href="ppRef2.html#Summations">summations</a>.
    </ol>
<p>
<!--li>I think I'm getting an overflow in power(). Can you trap it and display a message?
<p>
    <ol class="ua">
    <li>Not easily. All other overflows and errors are trapped (often returning "inf" 
        or eg "ordinal() error").<br>Maybe I should just remove this function.
        If anyone wants it I'll put my version of safe_power in userfunc.ew.
    </ol>
<p-->
<li>My calculation isn't working. How can I trace/debug it?
<p>
    <ol class="ua">
    <li>See <a href=ppRef3.html#Error>here</a>.
    </ol>
<p>
<li>In the example invoice print, Cash Sale(11) splits over two pages.<br>
    Cash Sale(11) is printed on both pages, Xchk 11 only on the first. Why?
<p>
    <ol class="ua">
    <li>OHadd1 ("Cash Sale(11)") is defined as repeat 0 (or blank), which means
    the previous value is printed (at the same position) on following pages.<br>
    OHpost ("Xchk 11") is defined as repeat 1 (the default), so it is printed precisely once.
    </ol>
<p>
<a name=align></a>
<li>How do I line up columns of numbers?
<p>
    <ol class="ua">
    <li>Make sure the columns are defined as single fields, not composite, eg
    "%8.2f"&nbsp;{OInet}, not "Net&nbsp;Amount&nbsp;%8.2f"&nbsp;{OInet}.<p>
    Also make sure the minimum field width (8 in the above example) is wide enough for all the fields
    in the column.<p>
    Column alignment is not attempted if the format width begins with a zero (as in %08.2f).<p>
    If you need to align composite columns, use a fixed width font such as 
    Courier New, Andale Mono, or Lucidia Console.<p>
    Some fonts are just not practical for this, eg Impact (actually that's the only
    unsuitable one I know of).
    </ol>
<p>
<li>The fonts on the screen do not (exactly) match those printed.
<p>
    <ol class="ua">
    <li>It is a fact of life that Arial 10 point as displayed on the screen and Arial 10 point
    as printed are a different size, mainly due to the large number of non-standard screen 
    sizes and resolutions, whereas paper sizes are much fewer in number and adhere to 
    internationally agreed standards.
    <p>
    The print preview can adjust the font size to more closely match the printed output,
    however a true exact match may not exist in all cases.
    <p>
    Use True Type fonts. Non-True-Type fonts only have a limited number
    of permitted display sizes (eg System only has eight font sizes between 1 and 100).
    A checkbox is provided above the font selector on the 
    <a href="ppRef2.html#jedittext">field details window</a> 
    to list only true type fonts (checked by default).
    <p>
<!--	Secondly, Check whether Font mapping is enabled on the report. In design mode, click on 
    the tools
    button (a hammer and screwdriver), and the fontmapping option is on the top-level menu.
    Note that when font mapping is enabled, several calls to getTextExtent are made for every
    field on every page of the report. Typically this makes the report load take about four
    times as long as without font mapping, so you may want to disable it on a slow machine
    or when printing very long reports.
    <p>
    Previewing a report without font mapping is perfectly adequate in most cases.-->
<!--	However, even with True Type fonts, some discrepancies are inevitable. For example,
    "Sunshine Garden Centre" in Arial 10 point is (approximately, lol) 40.61mm on the
    printed page. However the display sizes this at 48.79mm, 9 point at 43.4mm, and 8 
    point at 38.28 mm. Thus even choosing the closest match is out by 2.33mm.<p-->
<!--	It is possible to demonstrate similar behaviour in say Word 97. For fun, try
    entering "1.000" on several lines, in Courier, with sizes 10 to 19. Then
    change to Courier New, you will appreciate how much better True Type fonts are.

    <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-gb;22553">Q22553</a>
    (clearly out of date, and littered with varying degrees of untruths, naturally).
    <p-->
    </ol>
<p>
<li>This is all very nice, but how do I just print a simple text file?
<p>
    <ol class="ua">
    <li>The simplest.exw program performs a simple print of its own source. The 
    layout used ("plain") contains a single field, repeated 82 times down the page.
    <p>
    Note, however the program must reside in the same directory as pprg.ew, and there
    are approximately ten support files that it needs. (support.ew, win32prt.ew, 
    window.ew, layout.edb and the bitmaps directory.)
    </ol>
<p>
<a name=Planned></a>
<li>What planned features do you have in mind?<br>
    <small>TpdBni stands for test program done, but not incorporated.</small>
<p>
    <ol class="ua">
    <li>There are a number of known omissions in v0.2:
        <ol class="n">
        <li>Snap to grid when dragging and resizing. This also means that tab between 
            controls may appear to occur in a random order instead of left to right 
            because one control is just one pixel higher than another.<br>
        <li>Repeat on Rectangles and bitmaps is not complete.<br>
            Unlike text, the size of a rectangle/bitmap and the spacing need to be distinct.<br>
            At the moment the right click menu only offers resize, not respace.
        <li>Registration and third party revenue handling are not on-line, yet.<br>
        <li>Layouts are not correctly locked to prevent multi-user amendment.<br>
        <li>There is currently no undo facility in report layout amendment.<br>
        <li>Label printing (as in sheets of several sticky things) is not as easy as it should be.<br>
        <li>Zoom control sizes are not always optimal (the list available from the drop-down). TpdBni.<br>
        <!--li>Line grouping formulas are not implemented. <br-->
        <li>Multiple field selection and alignment is not supported.<br>
        <li>Deleted fields from datadict.txt not trapped if still in use.<br>
        <li>GDI and other resource monitoring has not been performed for the alpha version. 
            Hence some resource leaks may occur. In particular, memory allocated for 
            bitmaps may not be released until the application terminates. 
            However it works acceptably in 48MB ram.<br>
        </ol>
        <p>
        Of course I expect the odd suggestion as well ;-)
        <p>
        No action is planned on the following points:<br>
        <ol class="n">
        <li>Calculated fields, once defined, cannot be fully deleted, even if they are no longer
        used on any report. (Due to the unique referencing system.)<br>
        <li>See also <a href="ppRef3.html#KnownProblems">Known Problems</a> which details some 
        minor issues with expression evaluation. The source of the expression evaluator is now 
        available if anyone wishes to attempt to fix this.
