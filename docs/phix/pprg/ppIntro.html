<h2>Print Preview and Report Generator</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3></p>
<p><hr><p>
<p>
    It goes without saying that Print Preview is valuable and time saving addition to
    almost any application.
<p>
    Often one of the most time consuming parts of application development is reporting. 
<p>
    Another extremely useful feature in any application is the ability for end users to
    easily amend reports.
<p>
    The print preview and report generator component presented here intends to address
    all these issues.

<p>
<a name=Features></a><h3>Features</h3>
<p>
    The core reporting engine is driven by three simple components which can be easily 
    mastered and used to create most reports quickly and efficiently:
<p>
<ol>
<li>    The records and fields to be printed are defined in a "data dictionary", which is
        a plain text file.
<p>
<li>    The report layout designer allows visual placement anywhere on the page of:
        <ul>
        <li>Bitmap graphics (optionally resized, greyscaled and drawn in any paintmode),
        <li>Rectangles, ellipses, and lines (in any colour, weight and style), and
        <li>Fixed and variable text (in any font, pitch, attributes, and colour), using
        fields from the data dictionary and builtin fields and functions.
        </ul>
<p>
<li>    The application creates a "datastream". This is simply a sequence of records as 
        defined in the data dictionary, in an appropriate order for printing.
        This is passed to the report generator to preview and/or print the report.
</ol>
<p>
    A simple and intuitive semantic based approach is used to paginate the report. The
    datastream allows a natural expression of intent, which is often enough to produce
    the required report. For example, if sales orders consist of a header record followed
    by several product lines, a page break automatically occurs as each header record is
    detected in the datastream. The examples in pptest.exw illustrate this.
<p>
    Advanced reporting capabilities are also supported, see the sections on 
    <a href="ppRef2.html#Calculated">Calculated</a> and
    <a href="ppRef2.html#Repeat">Repeat fields</a>, 
    <a href="ppRef4.html#Variant">Variant handling</a>, 
    <!--a href="ppRef.html#Grouping">Line Group controls</a>,-->
    and 
    <a href="ppRef4.html#PSHook">Page Sequence Hooks</a>.
    In the extreme case, an application developer can create their own table of fields,
    specifying the position, size, font, colour, etc of every item (explicitly broken 
    down into separate pages), and pass this for printing/printpreview, completely
    bypassing the report layout designer. 
    (See <a href="ppRef4.html#ADR">Application-Defined Reports</a>)
<p>
    However most simple reports do not need such features.
<p>
    <a href="ppRef2.html#Standard">Standard fields</a> and
    <a href="ppRef2.html#Summations">Summations</a> are available for page numbering, 
    sub-totals (page and sub-document),
    carried forward/brought forward amounts and report total printing.
<p>
    The standard layouts, as provided with the application, may be amended by the end 
    user without changing the application source. Complex calculations may be performed, 
    providing the application developer has put the required fields in the datastream.
<p>
    The print preview allows magnification of up to 999% to examine fine detail, and 
    from two or three pages to the entire report to be displayed on the screen.
<!--p>
    One, two, four, or eight page images can be printed on each sheet of paper.

    [Not functional in version 0.1]-->
<p>
    The report layout designer can also zoom in upto 999% for pixel-perfect working.
<p>
    A simple slider control allows 100% size to be explicitly defined for working with
    exact measurements on-screen, for any monitor size and resolution.

<p>
Naturally some detail is lost when you zoom out too far!
<p>
The point is not that anyone would genuinely want to see the above, but a young kid using
a 38 inch screen can see alot more detail than 65 year old eyeballs on a 15 inch museum 
piece, so the software is designed with no unnecessary limits.
<p>
<p>
    The report layout designer allows lookup of records and fields defined in the data
    dictionary and automatically copies the default field format into the print format
    string and the field name to the field list. Builtin fields, and previously defined
    calculated fields can be selected in the same way.
<p>
    Report layout amendment can also be embedded in the application to permit minor
    changes and ad-hoc reports to be defined by the client. No compilation or other
    packaging is required; changes made to a report layout take effect immediately.
<p>
<p>
<a name=Limits></a><h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
    DTP and word processing applications are clearly still the best choice for complicated
    needs and high quality printing. Wrapping text round bitmaps falls into that category.
<p>
    Only bitmaps are supported. Jpeg, gif, and other formats should be converted to 
    windows bitmaps.
<p>
    Details to be printed are determined by and passed to the report generator solely by 
    the calling application. No attempt whatsoever is made to extract data directly from 
    the ever-widening range of storage options. 
<p>
<p>
<a name=SysReq></a><h3>System requirements</h3>
<p>
    Windows 98 or later. 48MB. Single sheet printer. <p>
    The version of win32lib supplied is version 0.59.1, with printerDC made global 
    (earlier and later versions should
    also work, as long as printerDC is made global).

<p>
    There may be other users on the Euphoria mailing list (see 
    <a href="http://www.rapideuphoria.com">http://www.rapideuphoria.com</a>) 
    who have experience of these routines and may be willing to help. I also read that 
    list. Screen dumps, copies of layout.edb, ex.err files and other binary attachments
    are best sent direct to 
    <a href="mailto:petelomax@blueyonder.co.uk">petelomax@blueyonder.co.uk</a>.
    It is however always best to post a short message first and only send the necessary 
    files if requested. 
    Please note that html-only emails will be treated as spam and deleted. 
    If you get no reply in a couple of days, and you are absolutely sure the answer is
    not plainly stated in the manual, re-word your query and try again.
