<h2>Print Preview and Report Generator</h2>
<h3>Licencing</h3></p>
<p><hr><p>
<strong>In a nutshell</strong>, you can develop using this free, distribute it free, and 
end users can use unaltered reports free, but if an end user wants to tailor a report 
(and your application must allow them to do that), then it is not free. However it is 
not open source or freeware, and there are some conditions. You need to read this whole 
section to get the full picture.

<p>
    The software is provided as a non-copy-protected and fully functional component, 
    with an "UNREGISTERED SOFTWARE" watermark.
<p>     
    However, there are two methods of removing this, free of charge:
<p>
<a name=Remove></a><h3>Removing the UNREGISTERED SOFTWARE watermark without registering</h3>
<p>
    Whenever a report is altered, the watermark is removed for one month. There is no limit
    to the number of times this can be done. Hence application developers can implement
    and maintain reports without ever having to register, and while the report is being
    actively developed or regularly changed, never even see the watermark.
    <p>
    Application developers may also be interested in utilising the using the print preview
    and report generator registration mechanism to collect revenue for their own application,
    see Commission Codes below.
    <p>
    Personal users (if the report has not been stamped, see below) may choose to simply 
    accept the watermark appearing on their personal reports, or they may make a minor 
    amendment (eg drag a field half an inch to the right, then drag it back) to remove 
    the watermark. The process is complete in a matter of seconds. The only catch is 
    that you are not reminded to do this each month except when the watermark appears 
    on the physically printed page.
    <p>
    Business users may also take advantage of this indefinitely;
    however, the cost of wasted ink, paper, and time soon outweight registration 
    in all but the smallest commercial enterprise, especially considering that this
    process must normally be individually applied to each report in an application,
    every month.
    <p>
    I am assuming, of course, that during application development, and 
    even when printing sample reports for documentation purposes, this is at most
    a minor inconvenience, but that is not so when trying to run a business.
    
<p>
<a name=Stamping></a><h3>Stamping</h3>
<p>
Reports may also be permanently licenced, for free, at the authors discretion.
<p>
The application must include the 
ability to amend the report, so that while the application can be distributed free of
charge and function free of charge, if the user chooses to amend the report the 
licencing mechanism will be activated.
<p>
The documentation for the application should note the consequence of amending a report,
but should not otherwise seek to actively discourage users from tailoring their reports
(and therefore needing to register). If the user makes a backup of the layouts.edb file,
experiments with layout amendment, and then restores the layouts.edb, then the report
will remain stamped (but obviously any changes made will be lost). A warning message is 
displayed when an attempt is made to amend a stamped report.
<p>
Report Stamping is therefore a simple trade: Application Developers offer to distribute 
the reporting routines in exchange for not being personally charged, and not forcing any
cost on users who do not need to amend the standard reports, but creating the potential
for revenue.
<p>
Please check the <a href="http://palacebuilders.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/doc/ppLicence.html">
latest version of this document</a> to ensure this service is still available before
applying.
<p>
Mail details of the report(s) requiring stamping to 
<a href="mailto:petelomax@blueyonder.co.uk">petelomax@blueyonder.co.uk</a>,
along with a link to an online screenshot/manual page and a download area for the layout
database. Only nearly completed applications will be considered.
Reports with obvious potential for ad-hoc tailoring will be given preferrential treatment.
<p>
A hash code for the layout will be added to an internal table (hard-coded within the 
shrouded sources) for the next release. At least a two-week turnaround should be expected.
<p>
Please note that using advanced features via the pageSequenceHook() routine disables the
effect of report stamping.
<p>
<p>
<a name=Commission></a><h3>Commission Codes</h3>
<p>
    This section only applies to application developers. 
    <a href="#Register">Next section</a>
<p>
    The print preview and report generator subroutines will most likely form a key
    element of any application which uses them. Hence if you wish to licence your
    application, it makes some sense to base the licencing model on the existing
    payment infrastructure rather than re-invent the wheel.
<p>
<a name=setCommissionCode></a>
    Software developers may pass a previously agreed three-character commission
    code to the setCommissionCode() routine.<p>
    This allows the registration process to alter the price to cover the cost of 
    both their application and the reporting routines rental fee.
    The application developer may charge any amount 
    for their software, the price for the print routines remains the same.
    <p>
    The softare is then
    registered in one operation, and the developer does not need to write and host
    the necessary cgi programs or any client side handling for registration codes,
    sign up with payment card processors, dynamic dns servers, etc.<p>
<p>
    Some investigation may be required, but almost certainly much less
    effort than setting up a secure payment and product registration scheme from 
    scratch. The following sites may be of interest, in particular the phrases 
    "splitting payments" and "royalty sharing":<br>
    <small>
    [Note: at the release of 0.1 I am not registered with any card processing services]
    </small>

</table>
<p>
<p>
    If required I can make some changes to the licencing model depending on the 
    commission code, for example to stop the free watermark removal feature.<p>
Contact <a href="mailto:petelomax@blueyonder.co.uk">petelomax@blueyonder.co.uk</a> 
to discuss any queries.
<p>
    Naturally the nature and location of the key generation program remains under 
    my control at all times.
<p>
    Normal business prudence may be applied via a formal three-party agreement between
    the report preview author, the payment card processor, and the application 
    developer. The application developer agrees only to pro-rata transaction costs
    plus any royalty sharing charges. No other fees are deducted.
<p>
<h4>NOTE: alpha release:</h4>
<p>
The registration handler is offline for the alpha release. I have not registered with any
card payment provider or dynamic dns services at this point. Clicking on the register now
button opens a local dummy page to demonstrate the process (bar credit card entry screen).
This registers the software for 35 days (free of charge, of course). A critical review of
the simple html used would be appreciated. On a super fast machine you may need to be told
that the html page (created on the fly) is dumpage.html.
<p>
The following code will safely delete any registration key:
<p>
<pre>
    include database.e
    object key, data
    if db_open("layout",0)!=DB_OK then ?9/0 end if
    if db_select_table("paperstore")!=DB_OK then ?9/0 end if
    key=db_find_key(0)
    if key<0 then ?9/0 end if
    data=db_record_data(key)
    if equal(data[4],{}) then
        puts(1,"!!key already missing!!\n\n")
    else
        printf(1,"%s key removed\n\n",{data[4]})
        data[4]={}
        db_replace_data(key,data)
    end if
    if getc(0) then end if 

abort(0)
</pre>
<p>
Random, even supposedly valid keys patched into this location will not mark the software as 
registered (not, of course, in the case where you patch out a code using the above snippet,
and then patch back in the self same code). Three obfuscation levels are employed, 
yeilding a realistic figure of one chance
in some 11,933,748,722,699,985,749,344,875,170,505,900 of naive or brute force attack succeeding.
I have dozens of other such useless numbers if you be interested...<p>
<!--It is understood that other methods are much more likely to exist; for example in early
August, a trivial seven-line code modification to support.ew was discovered that would
circumvent all anti-registration measures (which has obviously since been plugged).-->
<p>
<!--The message, however, remains that c-->
Considerable thought has been applied to prevent 
traditional cracks, keygen utilities, and/or published keys being useful.
<p>
Understand it may not just be my software I am protecting, it may be yours too.
<p>
<a name=Register></a><h3>Registering the Software</h3>
<p>
    A software licence may be purchased for a twelve month period only.
<p>
    A button on the title bar of the print preview display takes three forms:
<p> 
<ul>
<li>    A green tick on a black dollar sign indicates the software is properly
        licenced. If clicked, the expiry date of the licence is shown.
        An additional twelve-month licence may be purchased at any time to 
        extend the current licence for a further year.
<p>
<li>    A green tick on a red dollar sign indicates the softare licence is due
        to expire.
<p>
<li>    A red dollar sign with no tick indicates the software is unlicenced:
        the watermark appears on every page of the printed reports.
</ul>
    Clicking on this button opens a window displaying the expiry date of the current
    licence (if there is one), a 'Register Now' button (unless the report is stamped),
    along with 'Support Query' and 'Cancel' options.
<p>     
    When the register button is pressed, a web browser window is opened showing
    typically the product code, quantity and description, and a "buy now" style
    button which will accept credit card details. (The exact details depend on 
    the card payment processor, eg RegSoft, Digibuy, etc.)
    <small>[In the current version this step is omitted]</small>
<p> 
    When payment details have been accepted, a confirmation message is displayed in the
    browser as follows (eg):
<p>
<pre>
                        Thank you for registering

                Your registration code is shown below.

                DSUYWHS2ED8NNTG4VDFG6123

                [Copy]
                The above button may be ineffective on some browsers. In that case please 
                select and copy the key by hand. The browser will close and the registration
                process complete automatically.
</pre>
<p>
    Depending on the browser version, and the security settings for scripting, either:
<p>     
        The screen is immediately closed and the registration key applied.
<p>
        The user must press the "Copy" button on the browser window.
<p> 
        If the button does not work, the user must manually select and copy the
        registration code.
<p>
        Once a valid registration code is detected in the windows system
        clipboard, the web browser is automatically closed and the key applied
        without any further intervention from the user. A registration successful
        message is shown.
<p>
    Note: If you elect to pay by phone, fax, or even by post, the report must 
    not be altered between sending payment and entering the registration code,
    and must be applied to the same report within ten calendar days.
    In this case you may select the report which is least likely to require
    amendment during that time.
    For further details on the availability of such payment methods, follow the
    above procedure and the appropriate links/instructions on the payment site.<br>
    <small>[The author makes no claim to the availability or otherwise of such alternative
    payment methods at this time.]</small>
<p>
<p>
<a name=Backup></a><h3>Backup</h3>
<p> 
    The user is strongly advised to take a backup of the layouts.edb file following
    successful registration.
<p>
    For security reasons, the registration key can only be applied within ten calendar
    days. Instead of saving the registration key, the layouts.edb
    file should be backed up shortly after successful registration.
<p>
<a name=Integrity></a><h3>Integrity Checking</h3>
<p>
    The software licencing mechanism also checks the layout database for corruption
    and unauthorised modification. If an error is detected and the override option
    is selected, any existing licence is void. Restore from backup to avoid this.<br>
    <small>[The override option is to ignore the warning message and amend the layout;
    this clears the 'corrupt' status but also cancels any registration key.]</small>
<p>
<p>
<a name=Hardware></a><h3>Hardware Upgrade</h3>
<p> 
    Note also that keys are tied to the particular machine and will not work when copied 
    to another computer, or in some cases when the configuration is altered.
    A new 12-month registration will be required.
<p> 
    Use the support query function to request a refund if applicable. Do not alter
    the encoded details in the message body.

<p>
    Aims
    ====
<p>
    Provide easy to use report definition, print preview and ad-hoc reporting tools, 
    and optionally integrate third party payment processing into the bargain.
<p>
    Personal (and determined!) users may deliberately alter reports (by hand) on a 
    regular basis to remove the watermark. (Note that attempts to programmatically
    alter a layout will trigger layout corruption errors.) Ideally many unregistered
    users will use the software, and each individually balance the time, effort and 
    wasted materials against the cost of registration.
<p>
    In this way, the registration reminder watermarks are quickly unacceptable in a 
    commercial setting, ie the end users who financially benefit from the effort
    involved in creating the final integrated product.
<p>
<p>
    The UNREGISTERED SOFTWARE watermark
    ===================================
<p>
    Reports which have not been amended within a reasonable timescale are "watermarked"
    to prevent long-term commercial use. Personal users are expected to accept this 
    measure should they be unwilling to purchase, however a commercial user will appear
    very unprofessional if they send, for example, an invoice with a clearly visible 
    "UNREGISTERED SOFTWARE" message printed on it.
<p>
    Commercial usage/removal of the unregistered software watermark is granted on a 
    rental period of 12 months. If necessary, multiple purchases may be made on the
    same day, each of which extends the expiry date by a further 12 months.
<p>
    Third party developers can enter into an agreement with the author to change the 
    integrated product pricing, to cover both the application and the report generator 
    component costs in a single registration process.
<p>
A key for one layout.edb file will not work for another.
<p>

<p>
<p>
-- Registration reminder:
However, if you are just experimenting with the software, or are determined to use the
 software without paying, I shall not attempt to upset you sufficiently that you stop
 using the software altogether. Why should I? I would gain nothing, and lose both your
 feedback and suggestions, besides you may recommend it to someone who will buy.
<p>
  Please note that replacements for lost or non-functioning registration keys can 
  only be posted to the original email address.
<p> 
Replace "NO" with "YES" in the following lines if desired (for application developers):<br>
<pre>
    Keep me informed of product updates:NO
    Mail me with announcements of other (software) products and services:NO
</pre>
  Product news announcements.
  an email with the subject line "Product news announcements" and the following text to
  petelomax@blueyonder.co.uk:
  Email address <your_email_address>
...
<p>
I also operate on the public mailing list, see Contact Details.
<p>
  If you have recieved this email in error, post a message with the subject line unsubscribe
  to petelomax@blueyonder.co.uk.
  Security reminder: You should not normally reply to spam messages as it confirms that
  your email address is valid. In this case you should munge your email address as you
  would normally, eg <your_name>@REMOVETHIS<your_domain> or similar.
  This will ensure that an automatic email address harvester will not be able to register
  your email address as valid (and potentially sell it on to other spammers).
