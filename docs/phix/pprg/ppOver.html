<h2>Print Preview and Report Generator</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3></p>
<p><hr><p>
<p>
    The following interacting components are required to create a report:
<p>
<ol>
<li>    A <a href="#DDict">data dictionary</a>, which defines the contents of the datastream,
<li>    A <a href="#Layout">report layout</a>, which allows dictionary, calculated, and 
        standard fields to be placed on the paper,
<li>    An application program which creates a <a href="#Datastream">datastream</a>.
</ol>
<p>
<p>
<a name=DDict></a>
<h3>The Data Dictionary</h3>
<!------------------------->
<p>
        The contents of the datastream are specified in datadict.txt. For example:
<p>
<pre>
            --
            -- Example data dictionary.
            -- =======================
            -- Each record must begin with a unique two-character identifier.
            --
            
            OH          -- sales order header
            OHadd1 %s   -- address line 1
            OHadd2 %s   -- address line 2
            OHpost %s   -- postcode
            OHdate %s   -- order date
            OHacc  %s   -- account number
            OHtot %9.2f -- order total

            OI          -- sales order detail line
            OIprod %s   -- product code
            OIdesc %s   -- description
            OIqty %8.3f -- quantity 
            OIpri %8.2f -- price
            OInet %8.2f -- net
            OIvat %8.2f -- VAT
            OItot %8.2f -- total
</pre>
<p>
        This file is created by the application developer and should not be modified by the
        end user, however they should understand the contents before attempting to
        modify an existing report. It is of course perfectly acceptable and relatively 
        straightforward for an application developer to programatically create datadict.txt
        from existing data definitions in their application, though bear in mind that the
        comments, as shown above, are actually the most useful part of this file.
<p>
        Each record begins with a two-character identifier and is followed by a number of 
        fields each of which begins with the same two-character identifier, the field name, 
        and a default field format.
<p>
        The above corresponds to the report application passing a structure similar to the 
        following to the report generator:
<p>
<pre>
        {{"OH", "Sunshine Garden Centre","14-18 Durnsford Road","N22 7YD",
                "02/01/2003","217765",2041.56},
         {"OI", "TGS-GM-22-04", "Spade - 22inch GardenMaster s/steel",
                250, 6.95, 1737.50, 304.06, 2041.56}
        }
</pre>
<p>
        All comments and blank lines in datadict.txt, except for initial comments preceding
        the first blank line, are displayed in the field lookup during 
        report definition:
<p>
<a name=jdict></a>
<a href="ppOver.html#jlayout">Previous ScreenShot</a>
<a href="ppOver.html#jrecords">Next ScreenShot</a><p>
<IMG src="images/dict.jpg"
     alt="Dictionary Lookup.">
<br>
Dictionary Lookup.<br>  
<p>
<a name=formats></a>
        The field format follows those used in printf:
<p>
<table border="0">
<tr><th> %d <td> an integer     <th> %x <td> hexadecimal <th> %o <td> octal
<tr><th> %f <td> floating point <th> %e <td> floating point in scientific notation
<tr><th> %s <td> string         <th> %g <td> most appropriate of %e or %f
</table>
<p>
            Field width and precision can be specified between the % and the format letter,
            eg %8.2f indicates a floating point number with a minimum field width of 8
            characters and a precision of 2 (ie two decimal places).
<p>
            The following characters may immediately follow the % character:
            <ul>
            <li>"-" (minus sign): the field is left-justified within the specified width.
            <li>"0" (zero): fills the field with leading zeroes when required.
            <li>"+" (plus sign): a plus sign should be printed for positive values.
            </ul>
<p>
        The default field format does not dictate the contents of the datastream as
        created by the application program and can be overidden on each field in the
        report layout.
<p>
        Tip: use short format qualifiers (eg %s) to left-align fields. Long format (eg
        %20s, %9.2f) right-align fields, provided that no fields are longer than the 
        format specified. (See Faq:<a href=ppFAQ.html#align>alignment</a>.)
        There is also a copy of the sprintf documentation from Euphoria 
        <a href="ppRef3.html#formats">here</a>.
<p>
        Wherever possible, fields defined in datadict.txt should be simple text strings 
        or atomic values. The report generator can subscript and slice but not iterate 
        over a variable length item 
        (See FAQ:<a href=ppFAQ.html#appfunc>appfunc</a>): it expects 
        each element of a repeating structure to
        be passed as a distinct record. Complex structures obviously also invite future
        maintenance overheads.
<p>
<a name=loadDDict></a>
        The routine loadDDict() is used to load the contents of datadict.txt into the 
        layouts.edb file, alternatively this can be run manually from pptest.exw.
        See the section on Upgrade below[DEV: not in v0.1] for further details.
<p>
Record type comments should be defined inline, so they appear as follows:<p>
<a name=jrecords></a>
<a href="ppOver.html#jdict">Previous ScreenShot</a>
<a href="ppRef.html#jzoom">Next ScreenShot</a><p>
<IMG src="images/records.jpg"
     alt="Record Lookup.">
<br>

<p>
<a name=Layout></a>
<h3>The Report Layout</h3>
<!----------------------->
<p>
        Report Layouts are created visually using the report layout designer, which allows:
<p>
        Boxes and lines, in any colour, pen width, or style (Solid, Dash, DashDot, etc).
<p>
        Bitmap graphics, resized, optionally greyscaled, in any paintmode
        (SrcCopy, SrcPaint, etc - refer to Microsoft for details).
<p>
        Fixed text, datastream and calculated fields, in any face, size, and colour,
        and with any standard text attributes (Bold, Italic, etc).
<p>
        Advanced features including repeating fields, variant handling, 
        <!--line grouping,-->
        and calculated fields are discussed at length in the Reference Section.

<IMG src="images/layout.jpg"
     alt="Layout Amendment.">
<br>
Layout Amendment. 
<p>
        The field under the cursor can be edited by double clicking on it, dragged to a new
        position, deleted by dragging off the paper, or resized by selecting from the right
        click popup menu. New fields can also be created anywhere on the paper by selecting
        Insert from the right click popup menu.
<p>
        Dictionary, standard, calculated, and summation fields, can be selected by pressing
        F1 to F4 respectively or using the first four buttons to the right of the Format
        field. The format string is coped automatically, and the field name and any required
        brackets and commas inserted in the Fields list. F5 or the fifth button is used
        to define new calculated fields. This is covered in greater detail later in the 
        Reference section.
<p>
<p>
<a name=Tutorial></a>
<h3>Running the report layout tutorial</h3>
<!---------------------------------------->
<p>
        A short tutorial demonstrating the features of the layout designer can be run 
        from pptest.exw (or pptest.exe).
<p>
        If you have any ideas for additional lessons, please let me know.
<p>
        The source of the tutorial program is released unshrouded. It may require some
        changes to work on screen resolutions other than 1024x768. The tutorial may be
        amended to work with a standard report from your application, if required.
        If you make any changes, please send me a copy of the entire amended source (it
        is <i>much</i> easier for me to merge a complete source, please don't waste time
        composing an "insert at line 210", "replace line 327" style list, I will only 
        throw it away and ask for the complete source). Obviously I will apply your changes
        (within reason) so you don't have to when the next version is released, or at 
        least limit them to setting a single flag from 0 to 1 or vice versa.
<p>
        The tutorial runs on top of the live software, it is not a recording. Hence you 
        can experiment a little, but try to put the screen back as it was (and return
        focus to the Tutorial popup) before continuing.
<p>
        Please note that layouts.edb should not be excessively modified before running
        the tutorial, and that pressing various keys, using the mouse, or switching tasks
        while a demo is running are all likely to cause an abort (the title of the 
        Tutorial window changes to eg Hlt @ 4/17). This is to prevent the tutorial
        inadvertently passing keystrokes or mouse events to other applications.
        Once Hlt @ n/nn has appeared it is usually best 
        to exit pptest.exw completely before attempting to restart the tutorial.
<p>
<p>
<a name=Datastream></a><h3>The Datastream</h3>
<p>
        The application creates a datastream and passes it to the report generator.
        This is a simple sequence of records, where each record begins with a fixed two
        character identifier and is followed by fields as specified in datadict.txt.
        All records of a particular type must be the same fixed length. For example:
<p>
<pre>
        {{"OH", "Sunshine Garden Centre","14-18 Durnsford Road","N22 7YD",
                "02/01/2003","217765",2041.56},
         {"OI", "TGS-GM-22-04", "Spade - 22inch GardenMaster s/steel",
                250, 6.95, 1737.50, 304.06, 2041.56}
        }
</pre>
<p>
        Some of this data is a straight copy of data held on file, other fields can be
        calculated and/or pre-formatted in an application-specific manner.
<p>
        The most important consideration is that the datastream should logically match 
        the required printing process. It is also sensible to put all the readily
        available fields that might ever be used into the datastream as this allows
        clients to make small changes to reports without amending the source code.
<p>
        The application must sort records as required when creating the datastream.
<p>
        The report generator checks the first item in each record is a two-character
        string corresponding to a record definition in the data dictionary, and that
        the record has the correct length.
<p>
        In the example above, OHpost is the fourth line of the OH definition, (skipping
        any blank/comment-only lines), so to print that field the report generator simply 
        takes the fourth entry (counting the "OH" as 1) from the record.
<p>
<a name=getDDidx></a>
        Appropriate care must be taken that fields in the data dictionary do not get out
        of step with those created by the application program. The getDDidx() function
        can be used to return an index value for checking during datastream creation, eg:
<p>
<pre>
            if getDDidx("OHtot")!=7 then error() end if     -- assertion
                -- or --
            if rec[getDDidx("OHtot")]!=my_order_total then error() end if
</pre>
<p>
        If passed a two-character string, getDDidx returns the record length.
        If the parameter is not recognised or has been deleted, -1 is returned.
        Naturally it is unwise to use getDDidx("xx") to create a record of the correct
        length and then mis-populate it/fill in only half of it, it is much more
        sensible to code eg
<p>
<pre>
            record=repeat(0,7)
            ..fill in 7 fields..
            if getDDidx("OH")!=length(record) then error() end if
</pre>
        Since that clearly delineates (for future maintenance) the lines of code which
        must be updated.
<p>
        A single record can also be displayed for quick visual checking. An example of 
        this can be seen in pptest.exw.
<p>
<a name=generateReport></a>
        Once the application has created the datastream, it simply invokes the report
        generator, eg:
<p>
<pre>
            generateReport("invoice", datastream, pFlags)
</pre>
<p>
        Where "invoice" is a layout previously specified using the report layout designer,
        datastream is as just explained, and pFlags is 0, or one or more of:
<p>
<table border="0">

                                    and any other flags specified are ignored.

-->
<p>
        Multiple PP_ flags can be passed as a sequence or combined via or_all().
        [<small>not relevant in v0.1; more flags are planned for later versions</small>]
        Sharp eyed readers may have noticed that a value of #04 will logically show the
        preview, but suppress the printer dialogue. This is not officially supported.
<!--		Equally, PP_FILEMODE implies text mode (when they are implemented). The print to
        file on the standard printer dialogue creates printer-specific prn or postscript
        files (providing a suitable driver is installed), and is hence entirely distinct.
-->
<p>
<p>
        The default behaviour when 0 is passed to pFlags is: 
            <ul>
            <li>the report is previewed, 
            <li>2-up printing is allowed, 
            <li>Standard printer dialogue allows the printer and number of copies to be altered.
            <li>However, if the report is defined with the Screen checkbox set 
            (see <a href="ppRef.html#Zoom">The Zoom Window</a>), then it may not
            be printed.
            </ul>
<p>
<a name=onClosepprg></a>
        Before calling generateReport, the calling application should pass a routine_id to 
        onClose_pprg(). This is called to formally hand back focus to the application when 
        the print preview window is closed. Without this routine, the calling application 
        has no way of knowing when the report has finished (or been cancelled). Naturally,
        the calling application's WinMain window should not be closed until that point.
        An example of this can be seen in pptest.exw (actually pptwin.ew).
<!--p>
        TIP:
            Excessive use of append() (or &) to build a very large datastream can have 
            significant performance overheads. Instead use code similar to the following:
<p>
<pre>
            integer dsi     -- datastream index
                    dsi=0
            sequence ds     -- datastream
                     ds=repeat(0,64)

            procedure addRecord(sequence record)
                dsi+=1
                if dsi=length(ds) then
                    ds&=repeat(0,64)
                end if
                ds[dsi]=record
                if length(record)!=getDDidx(record[1]) then error() end if
            end procedure

            function makeOHrecord()
                ...
            end function

            ...

                addRecord(makeOHrecord())

            ...

                generateReport("invoice",ds[1..dsi],pFlags)
</pre>

<!--a name=Summary></a><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
    That is all that is needed to create a simple report. The example program pptest.exw
    demonstrates most common reporting requirements, including plain text, column, 2-up,
    multiple fonts, graphics and bitmap printing, variants and calculated fields, and 
    layout amendment.
