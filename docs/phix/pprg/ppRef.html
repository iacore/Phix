<h2>Print Preview and Report Generator</h2>
<h3>Reference Section Part 1</h3></p>
<p><hr><p>
<p>
<a name=Preview></a>
<h3>Using the Preview Window</h3>
<!------------------------------>
<p>
        The print preview window deliberately has as few visible buttons and controls as
        possible, to allow as much of the report as possible to be shown on the screen.
<p>
        A small toolbar is displayed over the window titlebar containing a minimal set of
        buttons for zooming, printing, page setup, and registering the software.
<p>
        Mouse and keyboard events which can be used are:
<p>
        +   Zoom in. The page can be magnified up to 999%<br>
        -   Zoom out. Display several pages on the screen at once, up to the full report.
<p>
        Cursor up/down/left/right, and drag with left mouse button held down to move the 
        paper (when it does not entirely fit in the window). Shift+cursor keys pan over 
        the document in smaller movements, Control+cursor keys move one pixel at a time.
<p>
        When in designmode (see below), dragging with the left mouse when on a field moves
        just that field, not the paper. The paper can still be dragged by starting on an
        unoccupied area. Dragging a field off the paper deletes it, after
        a confirmation message.
<p>
        PageDown/PageUp. View the next/previous (set of) pages of the report.
<p>
        Home/End. View the first/last page of the report.
<p>
        Escape. Exit without printing. Also Alt F4.
<p>
        Alt Z, or clicking on the Zoom button on the title bar. See <a href=#Zoom>Zoom Window</a>.
<p>
        Alt P, Control P, or clicking on the Print button on the title bar.
        The standard windows printer selection dialog is shown.
<p>
        Alt R, or clicking on the Registration button on the title bar. 
        See <a href=ppLicence.html#Register>Registering the Software</a>. 
        Support Questions may also be emailed from this window.
<p>
    The following only apply in design mode:
<p>
Moving the mouse over an existing field causes a dotted box to be displayed around the field
to indicate it is the current selection. This only occurs if the centre of the field is on
screen.
<p>
        Alt S, or clicking on the Page Setup button on the title bar.
        The standard windows page setup dialog is shown.
<br><small>[Note this may become a "tools" button, with several more options in v0.2]</small>
<p>
        Left Double Click. Edit the field under the cursor.
<p>
        Right click. Popup a context sensitive menu to insert a new field or resize/respace
        the field under the cursor.
<p>
        Context Sensitive Menu key (to the right of the spacebar on most keyboards).
        Same as right click.
<p>
        Tab and shifttab move between the fields currently showing on screen.
<p>
        PageDown/PageUp/Home/End are ineffective in design mode.
<p>

<h3>The Zoom Window</h3>
<!--------------------->

<img src="images/zoom.jpg"
     alt="The Zoom Window.">
<br>
The Zoom Window. 
<p>
        The zoom window appears when the Zoom button on the title bar (a page with a pair 
        of binoculars over it), or Alt Z is pressed.
<p>
<h5>Save as defaults</h5>
        The value in the Save as Defaults checkbox is examined when the Zoom window is
        closed. If checked, the values will be loaded automatically the next time the
        report generator is run. Only shown in design mode.
<p>
        Save as Defaults is automatically checked when values are changed.
<p>
<p>
<h5>Zoom</h5>
        The Zoom drop-down allows the user to select from:<p>
<table border cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td>999%, 800%, 400%, 200%, 100%<td>The default zoom is always 100%.
        A Zoom of 50% is half as wide, half as long, ie a quarter of the size.
        Other values may be entered manually.<br>
<tr><td>Screen Width<td>Sets the paper width to fill the window (so technically it
                          is only screen width when the preview is maximised)<br>
<tr><td>Full Page<td>Makes a single page image is as large as possible 
                          while still fitting inside the window.<br>
<tr><td>2x1,4x2, etc.<td>A number of multi-page views 
                          selected based on the current window size, paper type, and 
                          orientation. Not available in design mode. 
                          Note that this is a small subset of the views 
                          allowed via the + and - keys. Other values may be entered
                          manually.
</table>
<p>
<p>
<h5>Screen</h5>
        The Screen checkbox allows the report to be fitted to the display window (whether
        or not it is maximised). This allows print preview to be used to display results. 
        Printing is disabled when the Screen checkbox is ticked, and most of the other 
        controls on this window are removed. (This differs from Screen Width in that it
        fits both width and height to the screen size.)
<p>
<p>
<h5>Two-Up</h5>
        The Two-Up drop down allows the user to select from:
            <ol>
            <li>Print one page image on each physical sheet (default operation)
            <li>Two images, rotated landscape<==>portrait.
            <li value="4">Four images per sheet, original orientation.
            <li value="8">Eight images, as per 2.
<!--		Label:	[a planned enhancement that would allow a single label to be defined and
--				then printed in say two columnds of five.]	**DEV -->
            </ol>

<h5>A4 paper width in pixels</h5>
Due to the large number of physical screen sizes and
resolutions, which tend to be slightly different with each model, it is not
easy to calculate exactly how large the image should really be at 100%.
Drag the slider to either match a piece of paper held against the screen, or 
more sensibly, just drag to whatever size looks best.
Naturally this only affects the visualisation of pages on the monitor;
it has no effect whatsoever on the physically printed paper sheets.
<p>
This control is only displayed when the paper selected is A4 portrait, and the
zoom selected is 100%, and when in design mode.
<p>
<h3>The print button</h3>
<!---------------------->
This opens the standard windows print dialogue, allowing the printer, number of copies
etc to be altered. For further information, please refer to the operating manual, as
the exact contents of this window will vary depending on the operating system version.
<p>
<h3>The Tools Menu</h3>
<!-------------------->
<h5>Page Setup</h5>
This opens the standard windows page setup dialogue, allowing the paper, orientation,
etc to be altered. For further information, please refer to the operating manual, as
the exact contents of this window will vary depending on the operating system version.
<p>
<small>[Margins are disabled in version 0.2. Word wrapping would need to be performed
during datastream creation, in any case.]</small>
<p>
<h5>Design Aids</h5>
<!----------------->
<ul>
<li>Draw Grid. Turns the display of the design grid on or off.
<li>Grid Size. Specify a value between 1 and 500. A value of 1 will produce a mainly
blue background; 500 will typically draw only two small dots on a sheet of A4.
<li>Snap to grid. (Disabled). Not functional in this version.
<li>Position.
        The Position drop down allows a position hint text (only in design mode) to be
        shown using one of the following measures:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Gry<td>The internal value held as an integer. Most users should ignore 
                this. For diagnostic/clarification purposes only.
<!--tr><td>.<td>	Gry: noun: an insignificant amount; irrelevant. (Websters 1913)<br>
                The word was chosen precisely because it carries little or no meaning 
                for the average user, whereas for example pixel, or point, would almost
                certainly confuse and mislead.-->
<tr><th>None<td>Position hints are not displayed, the default.
<tr><th>Percent<td>A percentage of the paper width and height, eg 1.25%.
<tr><th>Inches<td>Imperial measurements are shown as fractions, to the nearest 1/32 of an
                inch, eg 1 1/16, 1 3/32, 1 1/8 etc.
<tr><th>Centimetres<td>Centimetres shown to nearest 0.5mm, eg 2.50cm, 2.55cm, 2.60cm.
</table>
</ul>
<h5>Rotate</h5>
<!------------>
This option allows a report to be designed in one orientation (landscape or portrait) but
be printed in the other orientation. The graph layout is an example of this (pptest.exw
will need to be edited to allow this to be edited/printed).
<p>
<small>[Note: rotation is not supported in print from designmode]</small>
<p>
<h5>Hints</h5>
<!----------->
Allows the windows tips to be suppressed. Note that the application may need to be 
restarted for this to take effect.
