<h2>Print Preview and Report Generator</h2>
<h3>Reference Section Part 4</h3></p>
<p><hr><p>
<p>
<a name=HFP></a>
<h3>Headers, Footers and Page breaks</h3>
<!-------------------------------------->
<p>
    The report generator intelligently interprets the semantics of the datastream to create
    page breaks automatically.
<p>
    If the report layout specifies a repeating field, then a page break is forced when all 
    available slots on the page for that field have been populated.
<p>
    If the report layout specifies a non-repeating field, for example the sales order number,
    then a page break is forced whenever a sales order number occurs in the datastream.
    The application can force a page break by writing a non-repeating blank field to the 
    datastream, once for the first page, and again each time the application needs to force
    a page break.
<p>
    Header and footer areas of the report are intuitively defined - simply those parts of the
    layout with non-repeating fields.
<p>
<p>
<a name=Variant></a>
<h3>Variant Handling</h3>
<!---------------------->
<p>
    Ocassionally it is necessary to intersperse repeating lines with optional lines, for
    example a sales order line may have associated batch, comment, and serial numbers.
    On a sales order summary report, both the order header and detail line information must
    be treated as repeating detail. Therefore on the report layout we need to specify that
    such fields repeat over the same area of the page, but obviously they should not over-
    print each other either during report layout design or when the report is printed.
<p>
    This is achieved using variant fields.
<p>
    Variant fields are defined with both a variant set and a variant number.
    All fields in a variant set must repeat the same number of times. 
    Note that repeat fields without a variant specified must also repeat the same number of 
    times. If, for example, an order page may contain up to 20 product lines, but a tax code
    table on the same page (similarly addresses or delivery instructions) might only repeat 
    five times, then a variant set must be used to prevent an error being reported.
<p>
    When a field is placed in one of the repeat slots on a variant field, then the matching
    repeat slots on all other variant fields in the same set but with a different variant
    number are marked as used, to prevent overprinting. This difficult concept is best 
    illustrated with an example, shown on different lines for clarity:
<pre>
            OIprod      OIdesc      -- variant{1,1}		repeats 10 times
                        SSserl      -- variant{1,2}		repeats 10 times
</pre>
    When a serial number occurs in the datastream, and the next available slot in the 
    variant set is n(1..10), then the slots for OIprod[n] and OIdesc[n] are marked as
    used, as well of course as the slot for SSserl[n] being marked as used.
<p>
    A following OIprod/desc would be automatically placed in OIprod/OIdesc[n+1], and 
    SSerl[n+1] likewise marked used so OIdesc and SSerl do not overprint each other.
<p>
    Explanatory note: In the above example, an OI record is a sales order detail line,
    with the field OIprod holding a product code and OIdesc a product description. The
    SSserl field(/record) holds a serial number just like the one on the back of a TV 
    or radio.
<p>
    In the report layout editor, variant fields are displayed on the screen using the 
    variant number, so in a set of ten repeating lines, variant 1 is displayed on the 
    first line, variant 2 on the second, and so on. Hence, as shown above, the SSserl 
    definition is shown during report layout design below OIdesc, but actually starts 
    repeating from the same place. Once all variants have been displayed, variant one
    is shown in the remaining repeat slots for the variant set.
<p>
    Variant handling does not apply to non-repeating fields.
<p>
<p>
<!--a name=Grouping>
</a><h3>Line Grouping</h3-->
<!----------------------->
<!--p>
    A grouping value can also be defined to keep groups of related lines together.
    This simply causes a forced page break when less than the specified number of
    free slots are available on the page.
<p>
    Although this can be specified as a fixed value, it can be specified as a field 
    from the datastream. The application creating the datastream can then set that 
    data value to force the following lines to remain together.
<p>
    For example, suppose that a sales order line has optional batch, serial, and 
    comment information, which should be kept on the same page. The programmer should 
    add a field, say OIlgrp, which is set to the number of lines which should not be
    printed partly on one page and partly on the next. The programmer should impose
    a sensible limit: the behaviour of the report engine is not guaranteed when a line
    group value is near or larger than the size of a page - it may print blank pages 
    forever, or put one line at a time on each page.
<p>
    The above assumes that the OI record is always the first line of any such set of
    related records. If it might be a different record each time, a new, dummy record
    to contain the lgrp value should be created and written to the datastream at the
    appropriate points.
<p>
    NOTE: only the FIRST field should have line group information ARGHHHHHH
DEV
    the first record cannot
<p>
    For more advanced requirements, eg to specify that a group of 10 lines should 
    not be split if that would orphan fewer than x lines on the previous page or y 
    lines on the new page, OIlgrp should be set to {10,x,y}.
<p>
    The grouping formula is entered as "OIlgrp" (without the quotes).
<p>
    Note that in most cases, the line grouping formula has a natural home, if there
    is a record (here the OI) which is always going to be the first line of any group
    of lines which need to be kept together, otherwise it must be entered on all 
    variants which comprise the group.
<p>
    An example of the use of line grouping can be found in pptest.exw.
<p>
<p-->
<a name=PSHook></a>
<h3>Page Sequence Hook</h3>
<!------------------------>
<p>
    This option allows the calling application to regain control once the page table 
    has been built, but before the preview is displayed or the report is printed.
<p>
    Before passing the datastream to the generateReport() routine, the application
    calls pageSequenceHook() with the routine_id of a parameterless procedure.
<p>
    This procedure can save a copy of the global variable pagetable and set it to
    -1 to suppress further activity, and resume processing following the call to 
    generateReport(), or re-order and/or combine the pagetable with previous saved 
    page tables which is then previewed and/or printed as one report.
<p>
    This technique allows cover pages, different styles and layouts for various parts
    of the report, breakdowns and summaries, to be created.
<p>
    Another use for the page sequence hook is booklet printing. For example six pages
    can be resequenced as {{},[1],[2],{},[6],[3],[4],[5]} and printed in 2-up mode.
    There are several ways to achieve this effect; the above is useful when printing
    the masters before using a double sided photocopier; the example in pptest.exw 
    relies on manual feed, and flipping the paper at the mid-point of the printout.
<p>
    When a report is printed in fragments, naturally the page numbering may be wrong.
    The application must manually correct this if needed, see the next section.
<p>
<p>
<a name=ADR></a>
<h3>Application-Defined Reports</h3>
<!--------------------------------->
<p>
    Occasionally, it may be easier to define a report programatically rather than
    manually placing each item on the layout, or if the layout is very fluid. An 
    example might be a complicated form with hundreds of small checkboxes.
<p>
    The application may use a dummy layout which prints a single field, and use the
    pageSequenceHook() procedure to craft a completely new pagetable. (TIP: create a
    very rough sketch layout, with a few examples, say the top left and the bottom
    right checkboxes, and pretty_print the pagetable from your pageSequenceHook
    routine, as a starting point.)
<p>
    Each page in the pagetable is a header record followed by a simple list of fields, 
    each of which is:
<p>
<pre>
        L-type  :   Graphic=1, Bitmap=2, Text=3
        L_pos   :   {x,y[,xto,yto]}
                    Only {x,y} are given for text fields.
                    The values are in Gry.
        L_font  :   an internal integer reference, but see below
        L_text  :   Text: format string, eg Page %d of %d
                    Graphic: Rectangle not present
                             RoundRectangle: {2,xc,yc}
                             Line: 3
                             Ellipse: 4
                             (See below for Arcs and Chords)
                    Bitmap: handle from loadBitmapFromFile()
        L_flds  :   List of fields to be printed
        L_flags :   No longer required, ignore
</pre>
<p>
    Please note the above definition is subject to change in future releases.
<p>
    L_pos is in gry, a fraction of width and height (1..100000). For example, a
    rectangle defined at {45000,45000,10000,10000} is the same shape as the paper,
    10% of the size, drawn in the centre of the page.
<p>
    In fact, L_pos holds additional detail such as repeating and variant details,
    which are no longer relevant by the time the pageSequenceHook routine is called.
<p>
    Text (not graphics or bitmaps) may be rotated by passing a slope value in
    L_pos[11], between 0 and 3600. The length of L_pos must be 11, zero fill any
    missing elements, as shown in procedure plain() in pptest.exw.
<p>
    Arcs and Chords may be drawn by passing {5,xstart,ystart,xend,yend} or
    {6,xstart,ystart,xend,yend} respectively in L_text. However the values passed should be
    in Gry (1..100000) and this feature is not officially supported. The following
    diagram (courtesy of Brian Broker) may or may not be helpful:
    <p>
    <table align="center">
    <tr><td><IMG src="images/chord.png"
     alt="Disgram of Arc and Chord drawing parameters.">
    </table>
    <p> 
    L_flags is used during the creation of the table and is no longer used or
    needed (it is much slower to strip it out after the build stage than simply
    leave it in the table, unreferenced). It may or may not be present.
<p>
    It is probably unwise to attempt any changes to the header record.
<p>
    The L_font values in the pagetable refer to an internal font table which is
    not available to the calling application. The fonts may however be replaced by a 
    sequence as follows:<p>
<table border cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Text<td>{face,size,attributes,colour} eg {"Arial",12,Bold,Black}
<tr><th>Graphic<td>{0,pen,style,colour} eg {0,5,DotDash,Blue}
<tr><th>Bitmap<td>{0,0,Paintmode,Greyscale} eg {0,0,SrcCopy,#1A1A1A}
</table>
<p>
    Note that Paintmode should be SrcCopy when Greyscale is not 0.
    Greyscale should be an rgb() value with red,green,and blue
    settings at the same value.
<p>
    Naturally, validation on returned pagetables is very limited, so use this feature 
    at your own risk!
<p>
    No calculated or standard fields may be used in this case.
<p>
    Blank pages may be represented in the new page table with the empty sequence, {}.
    Note that an application programmer would force a blank page by printing a single
    blank field, when creating a report from a predefined layout, plus there is a
    header on every page. Hence this will be 
    the representation of a blank page in the passed page table.
<p>
    Make an unaltered copy of an existing header record for any new pages.
<p>

<DEV:>
    Upgrade:
    =======
    Modifying the Data Dictionary and repackaging for new version releases
    ======================================================================
<p>
The first version of an application is normally released with a standard layouts.edb, 
pre-loaded with the current datadict.txt.
<p>
When a newer version is released, the client may have a modified version of layouts.edb.
Hence, instead of overwriting, it should be upgraded.
<p>
This is achieved by distributing and installing a copy of the development layouts.edb
renamed as stdlay.edb along with the new datadict.txt and invoking the loadDDict() routine.
An example of this can be seen in pptest.exw. Note that the routine uses current_dir() to
locate both datadict.txt and layouts.edb.
<p>
<p>
<p>
    A new release of software often requires updates to the data dictionary.
    However, amendments to existing report layouts at the client site must be preserved.
    Hence, you should not release a new version of layouts.edb, instead it must be 
    upgraded when the new version is installed.
<p>
    The loadDDict() routine should be used for this during the installation/upgrade, as
    opposed to being run as part of the packaging process.
<p>
    The layouts.edb database will be created if required, and any standard layouts from 
UGH:
    stdlay.edb automatically
    incorporated. stdlay.edb also contains old released versions of the standard report
    layouts; differences in the standard layout can optionally be imported. The user
    is informed of any differences that cannot be applied automatically. These changes
    are also written to a log file (layout.log) for later browsing.
    The DLLstd program is used to create the stdlay.edb database. It should be run against
    the current development version of layouts.edb and the last officially released
    version of stdlay.edb, to produce a new version of stdlay.edb suitable for release
--DEV: why?
    with the new version of the application. For the very first release of an application,
    layouts.edb should be manually copied to stdlay.edb immediately prior to release.
<p>
<p>
Reference Section: Coding the datastream creation program:
=========================================================
<p>
    Checklist
    =========
<p>
    Does the datastream contain all readily-accessible fields so that small ad-hoc changes 
    can easily be made without amending the application program and/or using unnecessarily
    complicated calculated field expressions?
<p>
    Does the test datastream include at least one instance of each record type referenced 
    by the report layout? This will automatically check that each record is the correct
    length, as specified in datadict.txt.
<p>
    Does the test verify that the fields it places in the datastream are in the same order
    as the record definition in datadict.txt? Use the dumpDDrecord() function to visually
    check this, or getDDidx() to verify this programatically.
<p>
    Does the installation and upgrade process incorporate loadDDict() instead of replacing
    layouts.edb? (version 0.2 onwards)
<p>
    Are layouts.edb, datadict.txt, and any bitmaps used by the standard reports installed
    to the same directory? Check the list of bitmaps from pptest.exw for any absolute 
    pathnames.
<p>
    Are any difficult variant sets 
-->
    <!--and grouping controls -->
<!--
    in use adequately documented for future reference?
<p>
    Are the calculated fields properly documented? If you run the list calculated fields
    option from pptest.exw, you can select and copy the entire set and add your own
    comments for future reference. (If anyone really wants a function to return that as
    text, it would be trivial.) As noted elsewhere excessive use of calculated fields is
    ill-advised; beyond a certain point it becomes far easier to modify the datastream.
    Before releasing an application, review the calculated fields to ensure they will not
    cause unnecessary support issues.
<p>
<p>
<p>
Upgrade
=======
    If you do not allow clients to modify their own reports, then you can just create
    a new layouts.edb and overwrite the existing file when a new release of your 
    application is installed. Otherwise this is a very bad thing to do.
<p>
    At some point it is expected that the contents of datadict.txt and the datastream 
    it defines will need to be updated to pass additional information to the report 
    generator.
    With the exception of reports which are still printing deleted fields, all report 
    layouts must continue to work with the new data stream.
<p>
[Ed: this has all changed; ignore this until v0.2]
Firstly, the field indexes in field and dict must be recalculated. Any changes to 
the uniq value would have to be effected throughout the layout definitions, which would 
require a complete mapping to be built in memory first (it cannot be done one field
at a time). Instead, the uniq fields are left unaltered, by setting the index
on deleted fields to a negative value, and allocating new, unused values for uniq for
any inserted fields. This is also the reason why fields are never deleted.
<p>
Secondly, it is also expected that the standard layout definitions will be altered 
between releases, and further that existing users may have amended their layouts on
site. This is sufficiently difficult that it cannot be generally catered for, hence
the program DDload is provided with full source code, should you need to modify it.
<p>
The program DDload also performs crude merging tasks between:
<p>
  stdlay.edb    the standard layouts as distributed with the installed version.
  layouts.edb   the layouts as currently in use on site.
  newlay.edb    the standard layouts as modified by the development team.
  backups.edb   backup of layout.edb.
<p>
 The program performs the following tasks:
<p>
  On the first run[1],
    Creates backups.edb by copying layouts.edb
    Swaps the contents of stdlay.edb and newlay.edb
        Compares each layout in newlay with layouts:
            if unchanged overwrites with new version from stdlay.
<p>
    Displays a status screen with the descriptive text one of:
<p>
        1) No modifications detected - restored at user request     [o]
        2) No modifications detected - new version installed        [r]
        3) Modifications detected - left in place                   [o]
        4) Modifications detected - overwritten at user request     [r]
<p>
  Buttons for Overwrite and Restore are enabled and disabled as the user cursors up and
  down the screen. A total of the number of reports not automatically upgraded is also
  shown, and a remove temporary installation files button allows newlay.edb and backups.edb
  to be removed (after a suitable warning).
<p>
 Note[1]: This allows installation of the next version to safely overwrite newlay.edb and
 backup.edb, if they have been left on disk for weeks, months, or even years. The program 
 can be run any number of times until the user is satisfied all reports work as required.
<p>
<p>
<p>
        1. Controls
        ===========
<p>
            When the print preview window is displayed, several controls and information fields
            are displayed at the top of the screen.
<p>
            Quick Guide. The following subset of keys are intended to be the most useful:
                Page Up/Down, Home and End to navigate through the report.
                +/- or left/right mouse click to unzoom/zoom the display.
                Alt-P to print, Escape to close print preview without printing.
<p>
            Below is a full list of the available controls and keystrokes.
<p>
            Page <fragment> of <maxpages>. (Display only). This displays the total number of
            pages in the report and details of the page or pages currently displayed, for 
            example it might read Page 1 of 3, or Pages 7-12 of 48 if there are six pages
            currently displayed on the screen.
<p>
        Known problems
        ==============
<p>
            Tooltips not refreshed. (minor) The Zoom, Print, Setup, and Register buttons have 
            different tooltips but are only shown correctly on the second and subsequent 
            buttons if the mouse is moved completely off the toolbar before hovering over the 
            next button.
<p>
            Resize window delay. (minor)
            The easiest way to explain this is to describe how to reproduce it. Preview a long
            report (at least 30 pages), restore the preview window by pressing the double box
            icon at the top right, then use the '-' key to zoom out and use the mouse to drag 
            the bottom right hand corner about. Provided you have enough pages displayed on the
            screen and/or have a slow enough computer, you should be able to resize the window
            before all the pages have been displayed. This correctly interrupts the drawing 
            process and begins drawing at the new size. However, if you wait and let the
            drawing finish and then resize, the resize operation no longer interrupts the 
            drawing process, which completes before clearing and re-starting at the new size.
            I also note that the mouse cursor is not updated as normal during redraw when this
            is happening, also Alt-F4 and closing the window by clicking on the top right hand
            "x" are inoperative until the drawing has finished. This may be a problem in 
            Windows 98 and may already be fixed in later versions of Windows.
