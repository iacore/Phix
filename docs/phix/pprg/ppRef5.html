<h3>Example Reports</h3>
<!--------------------->
<p>
    This section documents the sample reports which can be run from the pptest.exw program.
    <p>
    Very detailed notes follow, and are probably only of interest to programmers
    already coding and hitting a problem they cannot solve, or wishing to fully
    understand some more technical aspect of a particular report; the casual reader
    may wish to proceed directly to the <a href="ppFAQ.thml">FAQ</a>.
    <p>
    
<p>
<h4>plain</h4>
<!----------->
    <ul>
    <li><h5>Data Dictionary</h5>
        <!--------------------->
        <pre>
            TX          -- For simple text print
            TXline %s   -- A single text line
        </pre>
    <li><h5>Layout</h5>
        <!------------>
        A4 portrait. A single field, TXline, is defined in Lucidia Console 8 point,
        repeating 82 times. The value of 82 was selected by trial and error.<p>
    <li><h5>Datastream Creation</h5>
        <!------------------------->
        The simplest.exw program creates a datastream as:
        <pre>
            {{"TX","--"},
             {"TX","-- simplest.exw"},
             {"TX","-- ============"},
             {"TX","--"},
             ...
        </pre>
        The most complicated thing in that program is expanding tabs. Note that if you 
        are printing a file longer than one page, there is no need to worry about page
        breaks - it is handled automatically for you.
        <p>
        The pptest.exw program uses a slightly more complicated approach.
        Initially, the report is printed using a dummy datastream of 
        <pre>
            repeat({"TX","dummy"},2)
        </pre>
        and the <a href="ppRef4.html#PSHook">pageSequenceHook()</a> method is used to 
        construct a pagetable structure directly. As noted in the comments, for this 
        particular report it would be easier to create a simple datastream (but then
        I'd need another example to demonstrate pagetable manipulation).
        <p>
        Version 0.2 does not support any external maniplulation of the pagetable header
        (paper, layout, font mapping, two-up changes may be allowed in a later version).
     </ul>
<p>
<h4>column</h3>
<!------------>
TXline (as above) is repeated 40x3 on each page. If this is changed to 40y3 the columns
are filled differently (row-by-row) on the second page.
<p>
The test datastream contains 125 records, so 5 are printed on the second page.
<p>
<h4>booklet</h4>
<!------------->
    <ul>
    <li><h5>Data Dictionary</h5>
        <!--------------------->
        <pre>
            BC  -- Booklet control
            BCspine %s  -- text for booklet spine, also forces page.

            BD  -- Booklet detail
            BDtext  %s  -- text for table of contents and back page.
        </pre>
    <li><h5>Layout</h5>
        <!------------>
        A4 portrait. BCspine is printed rotated 270 degress to the left of the page.
        A non-blank value is only passed for page 1. BDtext repeats ten times down
        the page. A standard page n of m footer is also printed.
        <p>
        The report is printed in two-up mode.
        <p>
    <li><h5>Datastream Creation</h5>
        <!------------------------->
        The pptest.exw program contains the following constant:
        <pre>
        {{"BC","Booklet Demo.        Pete Lomax      October 2003"},
         {"BD","                                                     A Booklet"},
         {"BC",""}, -- inside front cover
         {"BC",""}, -- table of contents
         {"BD","           CONTENTS"},
         {"BD","1 Cover page with vertical text for spine"},
         {"BD","2 Blank page for inside front cover"},
         {"BD","3 Table of contents"},
         {"BD","4 An invoice from the other demo"},
         {"BD","5 A mocked up graph"},
         {"BD","6 Notes"},
         {"BD","7 Blank page for inside back cover"},
         {"BD","8 Back cover with fake press clippings"},
         {"BC",""}, -- where the graph will go
         {"BC",""}, -- .. and the invoice
         {"BC",""}, -- page 6
         {"BD","Notes"},
         {"BC",""}, -- inside back cover
         {"BC",""}, -- back cover
         {"BD","           Praise for Booklet Demo"},
         {"BD","'Some demos fire the imagination. This one mugs it' DAVID BADDIEL"},
         {"BD",""},
         {"BD","'Subtle, beautifully understated stuff which marks this out "},
         {"BD"," as a demo to watch' THE TIMES"},
         {"BD",""},
         {"BD","'Satisfyingly weird and weirdly funny and just crying out to be filmed'"},
         {"BD","             SCOTLAND ON SUNDAY"},
         {"BD",""},
         {"BD","ISBN 0-00-555321-2"}}
        </pre>
        Note there are eight BC records, which force page breaks.
        <p>
        The procedure booklet() in pptest.exw resequences the pages as required.
        <p>
        Page 4 is replaced with a saved copy of the first page of invoice print, with the
        page number footer removed. Page 5 is replaced with an example graph.
        <p>
        Note that these are rotated to fit on the page as required; the invoice layout is
        designed in portrait mode, however the graph layout is designed in landscape.
        <p>
        Special prize for naming the book the quotes were ripped from.
     </ul>
<p>
<h4>graph</h4>
<p>
Change the initial setting of testlayoutname in pptest.exw to experiment with this.
<p>
<p>
<h4>invoice</h4>
<!------------->
    <ul>
    <li><h5>Data Dictionary</h5>
        <!--------------------->
        <pre>
            OH          -- sales order header
            OHadd1 %s   -- address line 1
            OHadd2 %s   -- address line 2
            OHpost %s   -- postcode
            OHdate %s   -- order date
            OHacc  %s   -- account number
            OHtot %9.2f -- order total

            OI          -- sales order detail line
            OIprod %s   -- product code
            OIdesc %s   -- description
            OIqty %8.3f -- quantity 
            OIpri %8.2f -- price
            OInet %8.2f -- net
            OIvat %8.2f -- VAT
            OItot %8.2f -- total

            SS          -- Serial number
            SSserl %s   -- Serial number
        </pre>
    <li><h5>Layout</h5>
        <!------------>
        A4 portrait.
        <p>
        OHadd1 is defined with a blank repeat field, so when an invoice prints over
        two or more pages, the address is printed on subsequent sheets.
        <p>
        OHpost is defined with a repeat field of 1, so when an invoice prints over
        two or more pages, it only appears on the first sheet.
        <p>
        Sheet @nOH of @mOH. This prints the sheet number and total for each invoice
        using standard section page numbering summation fields.
        <p>
        %ldate is a standard calculated field to show the date in long format.
        <p>
        @bOIqtyOH. A standard summation field to calculate the brought forward total
        for OIqty within each OH record.
        <p>
        %bfwdtxt. This field is defined using the expression
        <pre>
                sprintf("Brought Forward",{@bOIqtyOH})
        </pre>
        if @bOIqtyOH does not return a value (namely on the first page of each invoice),
        then the sprintf expression is not evaluated and the text is not printed.
        If a value is returned, it is quietly ignored by the sprintf expression (since
        there is no corresponding % format qualifier in the text), and the fixed text
        is printed unaltered.
        <p>
        Note that OIqty was selected for brought forward and carried forward totals on
        this example report solely because errors in calculations would be much easier
        to spot than if dealing with multiples of 117.50.
        <p>
        OIprod, OIdesc, OIqty, and OInet all repeat ten times and have been placed in
        variant set 1, with variant number 1.
        <p>
        SSerl also repeats ten times and has been placed in variant set number 1, but
        with variant number 2.
        <p>
        This means that when an OI record is encountered in the datastream, it occupies
        the next available slot (of the ten that these records all repeat), and all
        other records/fields in the same variant set, but with a different variant
        number, may not be printed in that slot.
        <p>
        In this manner, the OI and SS records are prevented from overprinting each other.
        <p>
        Note that the positioning and resizing of these five fields took some care,
        and a little trial and error to get absolutely right. However, if anything does
        appear badly out of place (when you are performing a test print on a newly
        created report, that is) it should be very obvious which field is wrong and 
        what needs to be done to correct it.
        <p>
        Lastly, note that because SSerl is defined as variant number 2, it is drawn in
        slot number 2 by the layout editor and the selection box only covers slots 2
        to 10. In some cases it may be helpful to temporarily set the variant number to
        1 to perform alignment and resizing against other fields in the variant set.
        <p>
    <li><h5>Datastream Creation</h5>
        <!------------------------->
        The sample code in pptest.exw has been cobbled together over a period of time,
        no coherent overall explanation is offered, sorry. It should be clear however
        that each invoice is introduced by a new OH record and continues either until
        the next OH record or the end of the datastream. Any OI and SS records found
        between two OH records belong to the preceeding OH record.
