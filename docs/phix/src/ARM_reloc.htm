      <h1 class="title">ARM relocations</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
        The ARM ELF specification is written in what I dub ECAE-Thumb (Extended C Acronym English with
        Thumb and other stuff twice per sentence, though technically in the true spirit of ECAE Thumb 
        I should <i>not</i> explain what CEAE stands for). For example see 
        <a href="javascript:ExternalLink('ext897','https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0474/h/gnu-ld-script-support-in-armlink/example-gnu-ld-script-for-linking-an-arm-linux-executable');"
           id="ext897" style="color:#9B5565" >this link</a>, which, should you care to follow and read it, 
        <i>`is sufficient to link a "hello world" application`</i>. While you don&rsquo;t normally have to
        understand or deal with all that, it <b>is</b> the <i>default</i> under which most things get linked, 
        and I can understand it has to be that messy in order to deal with all the other messy languages it
        has to cope with. Hence this section attempts to explain only the bare <i>minimum</i> requirements.
<!--  the actual <i>binary</i> -->

        The ELF specification is insanely complicated, with (as one small part) over 130 different types of
        relocations. It is one thing/hard enough to decipher an arm binary, quite another to construct one.
        It is a classic case of over-engineering, albeit a very successful one, and of course it has to support
        umpteen programming languages, old and new, and of every possible underlying paradigm.

        Much is made of <i>got</i> and <i>plt</i>, with the latter apparently promising a saving of up to 0.0001s 
        on the load time for really big and complex programs, which I&rsquo;ll happily forego. Phix replaces all
        of that stuff with a much simpler mechanism that asks the loader to resolve more things up-front, but it
        currently only needs less than a dozen such entries anyway.
