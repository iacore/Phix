      <h1 class="title">Atoms and Integers</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
        Atoms can have any integer or floating point value.
       <br>
       <br>
        On a 32-bit architecture they can range from approximately -1e308 (minus one 
        times 10 to the power 308) to +1e308 with 15 decimal digits of accuracy, and
        on a 64-bit architecture they can range from approximately -1e4932 to 
        +1e4932 with 19 decimal digits of precision.
       <br>
       <br>
        Integers in Phix are limited to the subset that begin with 0b00 or 0b11: on a 32-bit 
        architecture they can contain a single value in the range -1,073,741,824 to +1,073,741,823 
        (-#40000000 to #3FFFFFFF), with no fractional part, hence technically speaking Phix 
        integers are 31-bit, straddling the "middle half" of the actual hardware range (-2GB..+2GB-1).<br>
        On a 64-bit architecture the range is -4,611,686,018,427,387,904 to +4,611,686,018,427,387,903 
        (-#4000000000000000 to #3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF), which technically speaking makes them 63-bit. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Phix does not entertain the idea of unsigned integers: zero less one is -1, not suddenly +4GB (which is what happens in C-based languages).
        <br>
        <br>
        While you can store any integer value in a variable declared as an atom, the reverse is not true.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are some Phix integers and atoms:
<!--eucode>
    0       -- (integer)
    1000    -- (integer)
    98.6    -- (atom)
    -1e6    -- (atom)
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000">    0      </font><font color="#000080"> -- (integer)
</font><font color="#000000">    1000   </font><font color="#000080"> -- (integer)
</font><font color="#000000">    98.6   </font><font color="#000080"> -- (atom)
</font><font color="#0000FF">    -</font><font color="#000000">1e6   </font><font color="#000080"> -- (atom)</font>
</pre>
        Phix stores integer-valued atoms as machine integers (4 or 8 bytes) to save space and 
        improve execution speed. When fractional results occur or numbers get too big, 
        conversion to floating-point happens automatically. As we shall soon see, should that 
        conversion be the wrong thing to do, you are immediately notified in a clear and
        no-nonsense, human-readable manner.
