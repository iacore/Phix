            Creates an interface element that is a canvas - a working area for your application.
            <br>
            <br>
            The parameter is the name of the action generated when the canvas needs to be redrawn. It can be NULL.
            A typecheck error occurs if it is not NULL and not a string.
            <br>
            <br>
            Returns the identifier of the created element.

          <b>Notes:</b>
         </td>
         <td>
            Note that some keys might remove the focus from the canvas. To avoid this, return IGNORE in the K_ANY callback. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The mouse cursor position can be programmatically controlled using the global attribute CURSORPOS.
            <br>
            <br>
            Drag & Drop attributes and callbacks are supported. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When the canvas is displayed for the first time, the callback call order is always:
            <br>
            <br>
            MAP_CB()<br>
            RESIZE_CB()<br>
            ACTION()
            <br>
            <br>
            When the canvas is resized the ACTION callback is always called after the RESIZE_CB callback.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Using with the CD library</h4>
            <br>
            When using the CD library to draw in a IupCanvas, you can use the callbacks to manage the canvas. The simplest way is to do:
            <br>
            <br>
            MAP_CB   - calls cdCreateCanvas  (current size is not available yet)<br>
            UNMAP_CB - calls cdKillCanvas<br>
            RESIZE_CB - Calling cdCanvasActivate and cdCanvasGetSize returns the same values as given by the callback parameters.
                        Recalculate the drawing size, update the scrollbars if any.<br>
            ACTION - calls cdCanvasActivate then use CD primitives to draw the scene, finally calls cdCanvasFlush if using double buffer<br>
            SCROLL_CB - when using scrollbars, if this callback is defined the canvas must be manually redrawn,
                        call yourself the action callback or call IupUpdate.
                        In other words, if this callback is not defined 
                        the canvas is automatically redrawn.<br>
