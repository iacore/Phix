            Store the position and size of a dialog, so when the application is run again the dialog can be shown at the last position and size.
            <br>

            ih: Identifier of the configuration database (see <a href="IupConfig.htm">IupConfig</a>)<br>
            dialog: the dialog to manage the size and position<br>
            name: a group name for this dialog
            <br>
            <br>
            The group name should be arbitrarily selected by the programmer to be meaningful and unique across the application,
            just as you would if you were writing out a .ini file by hand. For example "MainWindow" should result in a config
            file that might contain, amongst other things, "[MainWindow]\nX=200\nY=200\nWidth=100\nHeight=120\n".
            <br>
            <br>
            Use the function IupConfigDialogClosed to save the last dialog position and size when the dialog is about to be closed, usually inside the dialog CLOSE_CB callback.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the dialog was closed maximized it will be shown maximized. <br>
            The dialog size is set only if RESIZE=Yes. (since 3.16)
            <br>
            <br>
            The position is saved in the variables "X" and "Y" of the given group name. <br>
            The size is saved in the variables "Width" and "Height" of the given group name. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Internally variables are stored as attributes using a "<GROUP>.<KEY>" combination, which is why the group name cannot have periods ".".

Dialog Position and Size
========================
void IupConfigDialogShow(Ihandle* ih, Ihandle* dialog, const char* name);

void IupConfigDialogClosed(Ihandle* ih, Ihandle* dialog, const char* name);

ih: Identifier of the configuration database<br>
dialog: the dialog to manage the size and position<br>
name: a name for this dialog
<br>
<br>
These functions store and manage the position and size of a dialog. <br>
So when the application is run again the dialog can be show at its last position and last size. <br>
Use the function IupConfigDialogShow to show the dialog adjusting its size and position. <br>
And use the function IupConfigDialogClosed to save the last dialog position and size when the dialog is about to be closed, usually inside the dialog CLOSE_CB callback.
<br>
<br>
IupConfigDialogShow does no adjustments if the dialog is already visible, just call IupShow. <br>
If the dialog was closed maximized it will be shown maximized. <br>
The default size, at the first time ever the dialog is shown, is maximized. <br>
The dialog size is set only if RESIZE=Yes. (since 3.16)
<br>
<br>
The position is saved in the variables "X" and "Y" of the given group name. <br>
The size is saved in the variables "Width" and "Height" of the given group name. 
<br>
<br>
If your dialog is resizable and you want to avoid the last size usage because you changed the dialog layout, 
then reset the "Width" and "Height" variables before calling IupConfigDialogShow.
<br>
<br>
To avoid the dialog size to be maximized, set the variable "Maximized" to 0 before calling IupConfigDialogShow. (since 3.16)
