            Destroys an interface element and all its children. Only dialogs, timers, popup menus and images should normally be destroyed, 
            but detached controls can also be destroyed.
            <br>
            <br>
            ih: Identifier of the interface element to be destroyed, or a <a href="sequence.htm">sequence</a> of such.
            <br>
            <br>
            Returns NULL replacement(s) for ih (changed to a function in 0.8.2, prior to that was a procedure).
            <br>
            <br>
            Invoking say <code>dlg = IupDestroy(dlg)</code> sets dlg to NULL, reducing the chance of accidentally referencing it ever again.<br>
            There is no penalty or consequence for effectively invoking <code>NULL := IupDestroy(NULL)</code> and the {like}, in other words there
            is no need to laboriously check for elements which may or may not have already been destroyed, or never even created, and by using a
            sequence param/result you can destroy everything in just the one single statement, not that you need to for attached child elements.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Upgrading from pre-0.8.2:</b> ideally change all affected identifiers from <a href="Ihandle.htm">Ihandle</a> to 
            <a href="Ihandle.htm">Ihandln</a> and correctly overwite them as above, however of course you can just do 
            <code>{} = IupDestroy(..)</code> to quickly get things back up and running, hopefully as a temporary measure.

            It will automatically unmap and detach the element if necessary, and then destroy the element.
            <br>
            <br>
            This function also deletes the main names associated to the interface element being destroyed, but if it has more than one name then 
            some names may be left behind. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Menu bars associated with dialogs are automatically destroyed when the dialog is destroyed. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Images associated with controls are NOT automatically destroyed - because images can be reused in several controls, the application 
            must destroy them when they are not used anymore.
            <br>
            <br>
            All dialogs and all elements that have names are automatically destroyed in <a href="IupClose.htm">IupClose</a>.
