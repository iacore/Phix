            It will automatically unmap and detach the element if necessary, and then destroy the element.
            <br>
            <br>
            This function also deletes the main names associated to the interface element being destroyed, but if it has more than one name then some names may be left behind. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Menu bars associated with dialogs are automatically destroyed when the dialog is destroyed. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Images associated with controls are NOT automatically destroyed, because images can be reused in several controls the application must destroy them when they are not used anymore.
            <br>
            <br>
            All dialogs and all elements that have names are automatically destroyed in IupClose.
