            Creates a label interface element, which displays a separator, a text or an image.
            <br>
            <br>
            title: Text to be shown on the label. It can be NULL. It will set the TITLE attribute.<br>
            action: Name of the action generated when the button is selected. It can be NULL.<br>
            func: a callback address, usually specified as Icallback(<i>"name"</i>).<br>

            Returns: the identifier of the created element.

          <b>Notes:</b>
         </td>
         <td>
            Labels with images, texts or line separators cannot change their behavior after being mapped. <br>
            But after being mapped the image can be changed for another image, and the text for another text.
            <br>
            <br>
            To be honest, I made this function paranormalised in the expectation that (from my experiences with arwen/while porting test\terror) I
            would need to trap when a label got focus and switch it to an adjacent text input field. In fact, IUP does that automatically. So I was
            expecting to need to set "BUTTON_CB", but in practice have not yet found any need for action/func on a label. Good job they are optional!

Partial values are also accepted, like "ARIGHT" or ":ATOP", the other value will be used from the current alignment. In Motif, vertical alignment is restricted to "ACENTER".

            (non inheritable) Label&rsquo;s text. If SEPARATOR or IMAGE are not defined before map, then the default behavior is to contain a text. The label behavior can not be changed after map. The natural size will be larger enough to include all the text in the selected font, even using multiple lines. The '\n' character is accepted for line change. The "&" character can be used to define a mnemonic, the next character will be used as key. Use "&&" to show the "&" character instead of defining a mnemonic. The next control from the label will be activated from any control in the dialog using the "Alt+key" combination. (mnemonic support since 3.0)
