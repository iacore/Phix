            Creates a timer which periodically invokes a callback when the time is up.
            <br>
            <br>
            func: a callback address, usually specified as <a href="Icallback.htm">Icallback</a>(<i>"name"</i>).<br>
            msecs: an interval in miliseconds.<br>
            active: true or false, you can change the "RUN" attribute later.
            <br>
            <br>
            Each timer should be destroyed using <a href="IupDestroy.htm">IupDestroy</a>.

         </td>

            A generally useful example of using a timer to allow any currently active drawing processes to abandon before starting a new one can
            be found in <b>demo\rosetta\VoronoiDiagram.exw</b>. While relatively simple, it can make a huge difference to responsiveness (and in 
            that particular case, not crashing).
            <br>
            <br>
            In one case (Conway&rsquo;s game of life) setting a timer <i>before</i> the IupShow() prevented the latter from returning for quite 
            some time, and perhaps not until Escape had been keyed, so from that experience I strongly recommend not creating a timer until after
            an initial IupShow() has returned, and probably after setting any RASTERSIZE to NULL, otherwise it may misbehave - in the program
            just mentioned two things went wrong: Escape had to be keyed twice to close the window, and the canvas did not resize properly, and
            both were fixed simply by moving the IupTimer() creation down three lines.

            Called every time the defined time interval is reached. To stop the callback from being called simply stop the timer with RUN=NO. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Inside the callback the attribute ELAPSEDTIME returns the time elapsed since the timer was started (since 3.15).
