         <td>
            Creates a toggle interface element. It is a two-state (on/off) button that, when selected, generates an action that activates a function in the associated application. 
            Its visual representation can contain a text or an image.
            <br>
            <br>
            title: Text to be shown on the toggle. It can be NULL. It will set the TITLE attribute.<br>
            action: Name of the action specified by func, defaults to "ACTION", ignored if func is NULL.<br>
            func: a callback address, usually specified as Icallback(<i>"name"</i>).<br>
            For more information on the attributes and data parameters see <a href="IupSetAttributes.htm">IupSetAttributes</a>.<br>
            This is a <a href="paranormal.htm">paranormalised function</a>.
            NOTE: The C function IupToggle(char* title, char* action) apparently allows the name of the "ACTION" callback to be overridden, which I see no benefit to.
            The pGUI wrapper prohibits said, also note that as a paranormalised function, IupToggle(title,"MYACTION") would in fact be misinterpreted
            as IupToggle(title,attributes:="MYACTION"), however IupToggle(title,NULL) does no harm and is equivalent to IupToggle(title).
            <br>
            <br>
            Returns: the identifier of the created element.

            Toggle with image or text can not change its behavior after mapped. This is a creation attribute. 
            But after creation the image can be changed for another image, and the text for another text.
            <br>
            <br>
            Toggles are activated using the Space key.
            <br>
            <br>
            To build a set of mutual exclusive toggles, insert them in an IupRadio container. <br>
            They must be inserted before creation, and their behavior can not be changed. <br> 
            If you need to dynamically remove toggles that belongs to a radio in Windows, then put the radio inside an IupFrame that has a title.
            <br>
            <br>
            A toggle that is a child of an IupRadio automatically receives a name when its is mapped into the native system.

            (non inheritable) horizontal and vertical alignment when IMAGE is defined. 
            Possible values: "ALEFT", "ACENTER" and "ARIGHT",  combined to "ATOP", "ACENTER" and "ABOTTOM". Default: "ACENTER:ACENTER". 
            Partial values are also accepted, like "ARIGHT" or ":ATOP", the other value will be used from the current alignment. 
            In Motif, vertical alignment is restricted to "ACENTER". 
            In Windows works only when Visual Styles is active. Text is always left aligned. (since 3.0)

            The text background is transparent, it will use the background color of the native parent. 
            When displaying an image in Windows the background is ignored and the system color is used. Default: the global attribute DLGBGCOLOR.

            If the toggle is checked, then the borders will be shown even if flat is enabled. 
            Used only when IMAGE is defined. Can be YES or NO. Default: NO. (since 3.3)

            This makes the toggle looks just like a button with an image, but its behavior remains the same. 
            Use <a href="IupSetHandle.htm">IupSetHandle</a> or <a href="IupSetAttributeHandle.htm">IupSetAttributeHandle</a> to associate an image to a name.

            (non inheritable) Image name of the inactive toggle. 
            If it is not defined but IMAGE is defined then for inactive toggles the colors will be replaced by a modified version of the background color creating the disabled effect. (GTK 2.6)

            internal margin when IMAGE is defined.

            (non inheritable) Toggle&rsquo;s state. <br>
            Values can be "ON", "OFF" or "TOGGLE". <br>
            If 3STATE=YES then can also be "NOTDEF". Default: "OFF". <br>
            The TOGGLE option will invert the current state (since 3.7). <br>
            In GTK if you change the state of a radio, the unchecked toggle will receive an <a href="#ACTION">ACTION</a> callback notification. <br>
            Can only be set to Yes for a toggle inside a radio, it will automatically set to OFF the previous toggle that was ON.

            (non inheritable) Toggle&rsquo;s text. <br>
            If IMAGE is not defined before map, then the default behavior is to contain a text. <br>
            The button behavior can not be changed after map. <br>
            The natural size will be larger enough to include all the text in the selected font, even using multiple lines, plus the button borders or check box if any. <br>
            The '\n' character is accepted for line change. <br>
            The "&" character can be used to define a mnemonic, the next character will be used as key. <br>
            Use "&&" to show the "&" character instead on defining a mnemonic. <br>
            The toggle can be activated from any control in the dialog using the "Alt+key" combination. (mnemonic support since 3.0)
