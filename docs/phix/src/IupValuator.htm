         <td>
            Creates a Valuator control. Selects a value in a limited interval. Also known as Scale, Slider, or Trackbar in native systems.
            <br>
            <br>
            orientation: optional orientation of valuator. Can be NULL. See ORIENTATION attribute.<br>
            action: Name of the action specified by func, defaults to "ACTION" (you probably need "VALUECHANGED_CB"), ignored if func is NULL.<br>
            func: a callback address, usually specified as Icallback(<i>"name"</i>).<br>
            For more information on the attributes and data parameters see <a href="IupSetAttributes.htm">IupSetAttributes</a>.<br>
            This is a <a href="paranormal.htm">paranormalised function</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Returns: the identifier of the created element.

            In Motif, after the user clicks the handler a KILLFOCUS will be ignored when the control loses its focus.

            Keyboard Mapping<br>
            This is the default mapping when INVERTED has the default value, or ORIENTATION=HORIZONTAL+INVERTED=NO.
            <br>
            <br>
            Keys Action for HORIZONTAL <br>
            Right Arrow move right, increment by one step <br>
            Left Arrow move left, decrement by one step <br>
            Ctrl+Right Arrow or PgDn move right, increment by one page step <br>
            Ctrl+Left Arrow or PgUp move left, decrement by one page step <br>
            Home move all left, set to minimum <br>
            End move all right, set to maximum 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is the default mapping when INVERTED has the default value, or ORIENTATION=VERTICAL+INVERTED=YES.
            <br>
            <br>
            Keys Action for VERTICAL <br>
            Up Arrow move up, increment by one step <br>
            Down Arrow move down, decrement by one step <br>
            Ctrl+Up Arrow or PgUp move up, increment by one page step <br>
            Ctrl+Down Arrow or PgDn move down, decrement by one page step <br>
            Home move all up, set to maximum <br>
            End move all down, set to minimum 
            <br>
            <br>
            Visually all the keys move to the same direction independent from the INVERTED attribute.
            <br>
            <br>
            Semantically all the keys change the value depending on the INVERTED attribute.
            <br>
            <br>
            This behavior differs slightly from the native controls (Home and End keys are different). But it is the same in all systems.
            <br>
            <br>
            Invokes the C function IupVal. In pGUI, <nobr>IupVal()</nobr> and <nobr>IupValuator()</nobr> are identical; use whichever you prefer. 
            I felt there was something a little ambiguous about "IupVal" (eg value/valid), whereas "IupValuator" should cause fewer false assumptions.

            The initial value depends on ORIENTATION passed as parameter on creation, if ORIENTATION=VERTICAL default is YES, if ORIENTATION=HORIZONTAL default is NO. (since 3.0)

            The increment size is "pagestep*(max-min)", so it must be 0<pagestep<1. Default is "0.1".

            (non inheritable) The initial size is 100 pixels along the major axis, and the handler normal size on the minor axis. 
            If there are ticks then they are added to the natural size on the minor axis. The handler can be smaller than the normal size. 
            Set to NULL to allow the automatic layout use smaller values.

         <td>
            [Windows and Motif Only] The number of tick marks along the valuator trail. 
            Minimum value is "2". Default is "0", in this case the ticks are not shown. 
            It can not be changed to 0 from a non zero value, or vice-versa, after the control is mapped. GTK does not support ticks.

            [Windows Only] (creation only) Allows to position the ticks in both sides (BOTH) or in the reverse side (REVERSE). 
            Default: NORMAL. 
            The normal position for horizontal orientation is at the top of the control, and for vertical orientation is at the left of the control. 
            In Motif, the ticks position is always normal. (since 3.0)
