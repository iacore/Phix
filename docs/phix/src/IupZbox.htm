            Creates a void container for composing elements in hidden layers with only one layer visible. It is a box that piles up the children it contains, only the one child is visible.

            children: list of the elements that will be placed in the box. It can be empty.<br>

         </td>
         <td>
            Zbox works by changing the VISIBLE attribute of its children, so if any of the grand children has its VISIBLE attribute directly defined then Zbox will NOT change its state.
            <br>
            <br>
            The box can be created with no elements and be dynamic filled using <a href="IupAppend.htm">IupAppend</a>() or <a href="IupInsert.htm">IupInsert</a>().
            <br>
            <br>
            IMPORTANT: each element must have a name defined by IupSetHandle.
            <br>
            <br>
            Its children automatically receives a name when the child is appended or inserted into the tabs. (since 3.16) 
            <br>
            <br>
            The ZBOX relies on the VISIBLE attribute. If a child that is hidden by the zbox has its VISIBLE attribute changed then it can be made visible regardless of the zbox configuration. For the zbox behave as a IupTabs use native containers as immediate children of the zbox, like IupScrollBox, IupTabs, IupFrame or IupBackgroundBox.
            <br>
            <br>
            When translating C code, note that internally Phix only uses the C function IupZboxv, which accepts a single null-terminated list, 
            and does not use the variable-parameter C IupZbox function. It is perfectly legal (in Phix) to specify an empty list ({}) for the 
            children parameter, but not NULL.

            (non inheritable) The visible child accessed by its name. The value passed must be the name of one of the children contained in the zbox. Use IupSetHandle or IupSetAttributeHandle to associate a child to a name. In Lua you can also use the element reference directly. When the value is changed the selected child is made visible and all other children are made invisible, regardless their previous visible state.
