            All numbering is one-based, just like Phix, with the
            exception of image coordinates and memory accesses. Where
            possible a failed function returns 0. Many routine names in
            ARWEN are similar to those in Win32lib because they are logical
            and similar to their native Win32 counterparts. This should make
            ARWEN easier to use if you are familiar with either the former or
            the latter. Windows, Controls, Menus and Menu elements are
            referenced using their ID (which is the library's internal
            representation for the item) and images (bitmaps, icons &amp;
            cursors) are currently referenced using the Windows handle (hWnd)
            for the image, however, DIB sections have an ID which is similar
            in principle to control IDs in ARWEN. Please see the DIB section
            documentation for more details. I have tried to prevent ARWEN
            from getting in the way of potential flexibility and the user
            will therefore be required to pass certain Win32 constants as
            parameters in some functions. It may be advisable for a user to
            obtain the Win32 documentation that is referenced on the Euphoria
            website and keep it handy during a programming session. In the
            event that your program crashes because of some internal library
            problem then please send me the ex.err file plus any other
            details necessary to explain the error and I'll try to deduce
            what went wrong.
