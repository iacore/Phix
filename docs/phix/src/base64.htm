        The file builtins\base64.e (an autoinclude) provides support for converting data
        to and from base64, which is safe to transmit over the internet.
        <br>
        <br>
        Base64 is used to encode binary data into an ASCII string; this allows
         binary data to be transmitted using media designed to transmit text data only.<br>
         See <a href="javascript:ExternalLink('ext959');" id="ext959" style="color:#9B5565">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64</a>
         and the RFC 2045 standard for more information.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can think of base64 as similar to hexadecimal, except that it packs 6 bits of information into every byte rather than 4.<br>
        Obviously, for comparison with the 6 and 4, the raw data contains a full 8 bits of information in every byte. <br>
        Ignoring padding (at most 3 bytes) and line breaks (2 bytes between every 76), an encoded string is 33.33% larger than the raw data, 
        and the decoded data is 75% of the size of the base64-encoded string.
        <br>
        <br>
        These routines are fully supported by <a href="p2js.htm"><span class="pwap2js"><b>pwa/p2js</b></span></a>.
