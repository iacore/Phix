      <h1 class="title">beep</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
        The file builtins\beep.e (not an autoinclude) contains a single and (somewhat painfully) simple beep procedure.
        <br>
        <br>
        include builtins\beep.e<br>
        <b>beep</b>(<a href="object.htm">object</a> frequency=440, duration=500, 
                    <a href="atom.htm">atom</a> /*volume*/=1)
        <br>
        <br>
        frequency can be an atom or a sequence of atoms, in Hz<br>
        duration can be an atom or a sequence of atoms, in milliseconds<br>
        When both are sequences, an error occurs if their lengths don&rsquo;t match.<br>
        When frequency is an atom and duration is a sequence, even-indexed durations are silent.
<!--
        
        An error also occurs if frequency is an atom but duration is a sequence that has a length anything other than precisely one.
-->

        The volume parameter does nothing on desktop/Phix, but under p2js it should be a floating point value between 0 (muted) and 1 (full)
        <br>
        <br>
        This routine is fully supported by <a href="p2js.htm"><span class="pwap2js"><b>pwa/p2js</b></span></a>.
        An equivalent is manually implemented in pwa\p2js.js: p2js.exw should cope, and not transpile the desktop\builtin version, 
        even when it is explicitly included.
        <br>
        <br>
        Note that a web browser will refuse permission to initiate a beep unless triggered by a user action such as clicking on a button.<br>
        Consequently you are unlikely to get anywhere under pwa/p2js unless <a href="pGUI.htm">pGUI</a> is also included, or perhaps some 
        other web-compatible UI lib, should another one have been created by the time you read this.
        <br>

        The noise generated, if not mercifully short, is generally rather unpleasant, but I suppose if you need to know something has
        crashed and needs attention while you&rsquo;re in the kitchen, say, this&rsquo;ll just about do.
