            Activates a canvas for drawing. This is used only for a few drivers. <br>
            Native Window and IUP drivers will update the canvas size if the window size has changed. <br>
            Double Buffer driver will recreate the image buffer if the window canvas size has changed. <br>
            In these cases the function MUST be called, for other drivers is useless.
