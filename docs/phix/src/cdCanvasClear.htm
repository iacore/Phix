            Clears the active canvas using the current background color. <br>
            This action is interpreted very differently by each driver. <br>
            Many drivers simply draw a rectangle with the current background color. <br>
            It is NOT necessary to call cdClear when the canvas has just been created, as at this moment it is already clean. <br>
            Most file-based drivers do not implement this function.
