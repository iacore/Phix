            Defines the vertical and horizontal alignment of a text as: CD_NORTH, CD_SOUTH, CD_EAST, CD_WEST, CD_NORTH_EAST, 
            CD_NORTH_WEST, CD_SOUTH_EAST, CD_SOUTH_WEST, CD_CENTER, CD_BASE_LEFT, CD_BASE_CENTER, or CD_BASE_RIGHT. <br>
            Default value: CD_BASE_LEFT.
            <br>
            <br>
            The following diagram illustrates for all 12 settings where the text will be drawn relative to a specified x,y position as indicated by the six asterisks:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="wraptocenter">
             <span></span>
             <img src="images/align.gif" class="boxed" width="273" height="227" />
            </div>
            <br>
            PL: afaict CD_BASE_LEFT and CD_SOUTH_WEST, CD_BASE_CENTER and CD_SOUTH, and CD_BASE_RIGHT and CD_SOUTH_EAST achieve 
            the same effect, although they are not defined like that. Since the pwa/p2js re-implementation maps the enumeration
            to separate textAlign and textBaseline settings, the reconsititution in cdCanvasGetTextAlignment() introduces some
            inevitable inconsistencies compared to the desktop version, in that it can only ever either always or never return 
            any of the CD_BASE_XXX and is currently doing the never thing. It could I suppose be fixed easily enough by adding
            a new independent and otherwise unused attribute setting, should that ever be required.

            <br>
            When translating C code, <span class="illegal">cdCanvasTextAlignment</span>() must have Set/Get inserted. <br>
            The old school <span class="illegal">cdTextAlignment</span>() routine that did not need an explicit canvas is no longer 
            operational (as of IUP version 3.25, not my call or decision).
