      <div id="mainSection">
       <p>Phix supports both line and nested block comments.</p>

       <p>Line comments are started by two dashes and extend to the end of the current line, e.g.</p>
<pre>
     -- this is a comment
</pre>
       <p>Comments are ignored by the compiler and have no effect on execution speed. By default Edita displays comments in Navy.</p>

       <p>On the first line (only) of your program, you can use a special comment beginning with #!, e.g.</p>

<pre>
     #!/home/pete/phix/pu  
</pre>
 
       <p>This is reserved for Linux, to inform the shell that your file should be executed by the Phix interpreter, 
        and gives the full path to the interpreter. (At the time of writing, the Linux version of Phix is not available, 
        though I have built some simple ELF binaries, configured a suitable test machine, and written a disassembler.) 
        [DEV] If you make your file executable, you can (will be able to) run it, just by typing its name, and without 
        the need to type "exu". On Windows this line is treated as a comment.</p>

       <p>Block comments are started with /* or --/* and end with */ or --*/ and can be nested to any depth, e.g.</p>

<pre>
     /*
       This is a comment
     */
</pre>
