            Copy a file.

            <br>
            src: the name of the file to copy. It must exist and cannot be a directory.<br>
            dest: a sequence, the new name or location of the file.<br>
            overwrite: 0 (the default) prevents an existing destination file from being overwritten. 
                       Non-zero permits the overwriting of any existing destination file.
            <br>
            <br>
            Returns: An <a href="integer.htm">integer</a>, 0 (false) on failure, 1 (true) on success.

            If overwrite is true, and if dest file already exists, the function overwrites the existing file and succeeds.
            <br>
            <br>
            If dest is a directory, a file of the same name as source is created therein.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unlike some other routines here, any path separators should be appropriate for the operating
            system, namely backslash ('\\') on Windows and forwardslash ('/') on Linux.
            <br>
            <br>
            For best results, use fully qualified absolute pathnames. You should not rely on relative
            paths in dest any more than you do in src; for instance copy_file("demo\\test","demo\\test2")
            is fine, whereas copy_file("demo\\test","test2") is likely to copy to the parent directory, and
            copy_file("C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Phix\\demo\\test","test2") is likely to copy it to the
            current directory. The precise behaviour of path-less operations is operating system dependent.
            <br>
            <br>
            If overwrite was requested but the copy fails, there is no guarantee that any 
            existing destination file is preserved, deleted, corrupted, or all three.
