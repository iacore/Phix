            In Phix this is just a simple wrapper for <a href="get_proper_path.htm">get_proper_path</a>,
            which is defined in builtins\pgetpath.e (as is canonical_path), and there is only the one, 
            single, non-optional, parameter.
            <br>
            <br>
            The OpenEuphoria version has two additional optional parameters, is_directory and case_flags, 
            which are rarely used, or at least EuGTK and tinEWG only ever use the one parameter form. 
            You may need extra calls to upper() or lower(), that is to emulate OE behaviour, and in the 
            Phix version whether it is a directory or not is primarily determined from the thing on the 
            disk, and/or whether it ends with a slash (forward or back) character.
            <br>
            <br>
            The canonical_path(file,,CORRECT) form, which is equivalent to canonical_path(file,0,CORRECT), 
            can (afaik) simply be replaced with canonical_path(file).
            <br>
            <br>
            The latest OpenEuphoria version appears to have extensive additions for Windows Vista, and
            other unix/case-insensitive filesystem/enhanced dir() features that I would stand no chance 
            of adequately testing, plus the warning "Does not (yet) handle UNC paths or unix links" in
            the OE documentation persuades me against investing any significant effort here, just yet.
