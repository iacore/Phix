         <td>Specify a file name, s, for holding error diagnostics if
             Phix must stop your program due to a compile-time or

         <td>Normally Phix prints a diagnostic message such as
             "syntax error" or "divide by zero" on the screen, as well as
             dumping debugging information into
          <font color="#030303">
           <b>ex.err</b>
          </font> in the current directory. While the latter is quite predictable at
            program startup, it can be changed explicitly by chdir() or implicitly via
            a standard file open dialogue. By calling crash_file() you can control the 
            directory and file name where the debugging information will be written.
            You could easily write a routine which checks for the presence of any error
            files at startup and either rename things or generate a new unique name, so
            that a complete history of any run-time errors is maintained.
          <br>
          <br>
            s may be empty, i.e. "". In this case no diagnostics or debugging 
            information will be written to either a file or the screen. 
            s might also be "NUL" or "/dev/null", in which case diagnostics will 
            be written to the screen, but the ex.err information will be discarded.
          <br>
          <br>
            You can call crash_file() as many times as you like from
            different parts of your program. The file specified by the
            last call will be the one used.
