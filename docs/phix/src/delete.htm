            Cleanup routines are associated with an object using the <a href="delete_routine.htm">delete_routine</a>() function.
            <br>
            <br>
            Applications do not typically invoke delete() directly, but instead rely on it being invoked as part of the automatic 
            garbage collection process, except during shutdown when it may be important to force events to occur in a particular order. <br>
            Note that setting [the last copy of] o to NULL should achieve the same effect as invoking delete() explicitly, but in
            a much safer way, as per the comments in <a href="delete_routine.htm">delete_routine</a>().
            <br>
            <br>
            If the object is an integer, or if no cleanup routines are associated with the object, then nothing happens.
            <br>
            <br>
            After the cleanup routines are called, the value of the object is unchanged, though the cleanup routine(s) will no longer be associated with the object.
