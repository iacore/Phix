            Cleanup routines are associated with an object using the <a href="delete_routine.htm">delete_routine</a>() function.
            <br>
            <br>
            Applications do not typically invoke <a href="delete.htm">delete</a>() directly, but instead rely on it being invoked as part of the automatic garbage collection process.
            <br>
            <br>
            Examples where <a href="delete_routine.htm">delete_routine</a>() may be useful include freeing some allocated memory, releasing some other resource, 
            or removing indexes that point to an item, and this can be used if for some reason you need or want that process explicitly invoked ahead of normal 
            destruction.
            <br>
            <br>
            Multiple cleanup routines may be associated with an object, in which case they are invoked in the reverse order of association.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the object is an integer, or if no cleanup routines are associated with the object, then nothing happens.
            <br>
            <br>
            After the cleanup routines are called, the value of the object is unchanged, though the cleanup routine(s) will no longer be associated with the object.
