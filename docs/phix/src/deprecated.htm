      <h1 class="title">deprecated</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
        The arwen gui library is windows 32-bit only, and hence it is recommended that any
        new programs use <a href="pGUI.htm">pGUI</a>, which is 32/64 bit and Windows/Linux compatible. 
        It is however still supported and may be appropriate for quick one-offs.
       <br>
       <br>
        There are no plans to remove, drop support, or deliberately break anything in this section,
        however there will be few if any further enhancements to them.
       <br>
       <br>
        None of these routines are supported by <a href="p2js.htm"><span class="pwap2js"><b>pwa/p2js</b></span></a>,
        except perhaps for <a href="bigatom.htm">bigatom</a>, although the main/only advantage of that over 
        <a href="mpfr.htm">mpfr</a> is that no dlls are required, which is not applicable under p2js anyway, 
        though it is exercised in several rosettacode entries (Catalan_numbers[_Pascals_triangle], fibonnaci, 
        and Miller_Rabin_primality_test).
