            A serialized object is one that has been converted to a series of byte values, as
            originally returned from the <a href="serialize.htm">serialize</a> function, but 
            for any of this to be particularly useful, one that has had a fairly colourful 
            journey through files, shared memory, network connections, or some such.
            <br>
            <br>
            An additional parameter has been added to deserialize to control whether or not the 
            final pos should be returned when processing a sequence input. This allows several 
            concatenated serialised objects to be extracted from a single stream.<br>
            The OpenEuphoria version always returns {res,pos} when given a sequence, but not 
            a file.
            <br>
            <br>
            To retrieve data from a memory address, such as a shared memory block, specify a
            negative pos, with -1 indicating the first byte of that block. If pos is returned
            in this case, it will be more negative, and valid for a subsequent concatenated
            serialised object within the same memory block.
            <br>
            <br>
            Note that a returned pos is meaningless, and unchanged, when sf is a file handle.
            <br>
            <br>

            Some performance loss may be noticed in comparison with the OpenEuphoria version
            of this routine, which can be attributed to making it thread-safe.
