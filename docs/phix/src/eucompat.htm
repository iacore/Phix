      <h1 class="title">Compatibility with OpenEuphoria</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
       <br>
       <br>
        Obviously true 100% compatibility is a nonsense idea - you would be forced to reproduce all the bugs, warts,
        and glitches of the original, and to top that prohibit any improvement. Instead, 99.9% is more reasonable, but
        you should bear in mind that means you will have to alter, on average, one line of code in a thousand, and in
        practice that is roughly what I get when testing code written for RDS Eu and OpenEuphoria on Phix. To be fair,
        sometimes it may be more like 1 line in every 100, which equates to a mere 99.0% compatibility. More recently
        written code using the very latest 4.1+ features tends to fare less well, but still typically much easier than
        say migrating from win32lib to arwen.
       <br>
       <br>
        While RDS Eu and OpenEuphoria not only support (/encourage/tout) implicit sequence operations, Phix expects
        the programmer to use explicit routines, for example sq_add(x,y) instead of x+y, as detailed in
        <a href="seqops.htm">sequence operations</a>. The compiler issues warnings and performs an automatic 
        substitution of the equivalent function-style routine when doing do is <i>irrefutably</i> the correct thing to 
        do, but terminates in error at runtime if the atom-only primitives are passed a sequence. In my experience so
        far this has not been a significant difficulty, and trivial to fix once detected.
       <br>
       <br>
        The ",," style optional parameters are not supported by Phix. While, for example, both Phix and OpenEuphoria 
        support myfunc(file), only OpenEuphoria allows myfunc(file,,1) whereas Phix requires the second parameter to 
        be present - and of course it is usually a trivial matter to determine what that should be. In Phix all 
        non-optional parameters must be grouped together on the left hand side of routine parameter declarations.
       <br>
       <br>
        OpenEuphoria does not support named parameters, for example in Phix both message_box("there", "hi", MB_OK) 
        and message_box(style:=MB_OK,title:="hi",msg:="there") are equivalent. Note that once you start explicitly
        naming parameters in a call statement you cannot revert to a positional-based method, and there is as yet
        no way to use named parameters on any of the builtins implemented via #ilASM. See psym.e/symint() and the
        AutoAsm() calls for a full list of the latter, apart from the sheer number I doubt it would be particularly 
        difficult to figure something out - passing a list of parameter names to AutoAsm should get you started.
       <br>
       <br>
        Phix does not support forward referencing of variables and constants, though routines are fine. I maintain that
        forward data references add wholly unnecessary complexity, and evidently cause quite noticable performance loss 
        in the compile phase, in OpenEuphoria, and besides are very easily fixed whenever they cause a problem.
       <br>
       <br>
        A particular thorn is wxEuphoria which depends on the internal implementation details of OpenEuphoria and it is
        highly unlikely that a compatibile version of that will become available any time soon.
       <br>
       <br>
        Many routines in Phix, eg open(), puts(), etc already accept both "fred" and {'f','r','e','d'} but some may have 
        slipped though for reasons of expediency. Feel free to log a bug for that when it seems appropriate.
       <br>
       <br>
        The routines listed below have been copied from OpenEuphoria for compatibility reasons. They are only granted 
        the lightest of support and any grief may lead to an offending routine simply being removed rather than fixed. 
        Obviously if I thought these routines were really any good I would adopt them whole-heartedly; the fact they 
        are documented in this section means I have certain reservations about their design or implementation or both.
       <br>
       <br>
        Of course I would happily accept improved versions of these routines for incorporation into the next release.

        The routines listed below are Phix-specific and do not have RDS Eu or OpenEuphoria equivalents of that name.
