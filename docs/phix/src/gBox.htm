            By default, the box automatically expands to fill its parent (especially when that is a <a href="gDialog.htm">gDialog</a>),
            and then determines the appropriate expansion/spacing for its children. It is not actually possible to absolutely disable
            <a href="gSetAttribute.htm#EXPAND">EXPAND</a> on a gH/Vbox: attempts to do so depend on parent/siblings being able to cope.

            The box will NOT expand its children, it will allow its children to expand according to the space left in the box parent. 
            So for the expansion to occur, the children must be expandable with <a href="gSetAttribute.htm#EXPAND">EXPAND</a>!=NO, and there must be room in the box parent.

            When translating C code, note that internally Phix only uses the C function IupHboxv, which accepts a single null-terminated list, 
            and does not use the variable-parameter C IupHbox function. It is perfectly legal (in Phix) to specify an empty list ({}) for the 
            children parameter, but not NULL. Also note that C code requires a trailing NULL, whereas in pGUI it makes no difference whether 
            one is present (at the end of the sequence) or not - and obviously the C code <code>IupHbox(NULL);</code> should just become
            <code>IupHbox()</code>.

            In other words, <a href="gSetAttribute.htm#MARGIN">MARGIN</a> and <a href="#GAP">GAP</a> can be considered a baseline minimum,
            with SPACE distributing any excess when no child[ren] gobble that up. Quite often SPACE has no effect when the window is first
            shown, only swinging into effect when the dialog is resized, unless the box initially expands to some explicitly defined size
            or to match some sibling element.

            Should a gH/Vbox not itself expand in a given direction, then it isn&rsquo;t passed any slack in that direction that it has to 
            deal with in the first place, unless the standard <a href="xplayout.htm#SoleChild">sole child</a> exception applies. While you 
            can specify <i>fixed</i> <a href="#GAP">GAP</a>/<a href="gSetAttribute.htm#MARGIN">MARGIN</a>, any excess space is then either 
            all passed/split to expandable children, or spread as follows, with no way to half-and-half it, but of course each expandable 
            child can do whatever it likes with the extra space it gets passed, and especially so when it too is also a gH/Vbox.

            A single setting such as "SPACE=CENTRE" applies both horizontally and vertically, whereas "SPACE={BETWEEN,CENTRE}" sets the

            The [B] prefix sets the balance flag (0b1000), which causes the cross axis to behave as CENTRE and then be matched in the outer
            margin[s] of the primary axis. Currently (at least) for desktop/Phix only, simply ignored by xpGUI.js. Note the balance flag has 
            no (positive) effect should <i>any</i> of the children expand in the cross axis, in practice it matches the primary outer margins 
            with the (minimum of) 0. For an example of this (/BLEFT) in action, see the demo\xpGUI\gButton.exw example: margins are initially 
            11x11, so the top/left/bottom match, then kept in sync as the window is resized. Obviously you can remove BLEFT (or replace with 
            LEFT) to see the difference said flag makes when resizing, ie without it the left margin would stay 11 no matter what happens to 
            the vertical margins. It can of course only keep things in sync when there is sufficient space to do so, and it would be nonsense 
            to set that flag with BETWEEN, CENTRE, or NONE, or set it on the cross but not primary axis. To that end you should refrain from 
            using the B prefix or at least take extra special care when setting SPACE in a {h,v} fashion (which is at liberty to ignore/override 
            the cross axis setting to CENTRE anyway).

            <br>
            <br>
            Note that NONE is meaningless and officially unsupported, it may for instance thwart expansion or perhaps trigger similar 
            behaviour to <a href="xplayout.htm#SoleChild">sole child</a>, on different backends or in some future release. If it has any 
            meaning, that would be "you forgot to set this", or perhaps this container does not expand, or <i>never</i> has no expanding 
            children in the primary direction, or <i>any</i> non-expanding in the cross. That said, it <i>is</i> the default, albeit 
            behaving as RIGHT|BOTTOM, but should you want a guarantee, be explicit.

<!--
            Use XPG_SPACE_NONE with caution: it is often better to set EXPAND=NO [in the appropriate direction] instead, whenever possible,
            and if the box <i>can</i> expand then RIGHT|BOTTOM is probably more like what you actually really meant anyway. Attempts to set
            (EXPAND=YES then NONE) or (NONE then EXPAND=YES) will quite likely effectively clobber each other, not to mention that the 
            layout manager tends to run up and down the layout hierarchy accumulating expansion details, and of course effectively ignores 
            any instructions it deems impossible. 
-->
            Hand on heart, XPG_SPACE_NONE only really exists so the following routines can return something sensible (esp "NONE") when it 
            wasn&rsquo;t set, presumably because it would never be used anyway. The following edge cases can be skipped on first reading.
            For the cross orientation and single child in the primary orientation, (BETWEEN|NONE|RIGHT|BOTTOM) behave identically, as do 
            (AROUND|CENTRE), like they fairly obviously should. While we certainly need the RIGHT/BOTTOM <i>bit</i>, (NONE|RIGHT|BOTTOM) 
            [by their lonesome] also actually behave identically even when multiple children are involved (flw). The simple truth of the
            matter is that the SPACE attribute is only consulted when the container is given space and it does not know what else to do
            with it: should it not be given excess space in the first place it should have EXPAND=NO, or perhaps RESIZE=NO. That said, 
            when practical the layout manager is at liberty to assume you meant RIGHT|BOTTOM, rather than always/belligerently crash. 
<!--
            , and may yet be 
            replaced with the standard NULL/"NULL", and/or prohibited from being explicitly set to that. It may also turn out that NONE
            simply just gets treated like RIGHT/BOTTOM, and/or that while we certainly need the RIGHT/BOTTOM <i>bit</b>, that setting all
            by its lonesome actually achieves nothing.

            You could of course also use XPG_SPACE_((LEFT|TOP)|(RIGHT|BOTTOM)|BETWEEN) as bitmasks on the above integer as well, not that I can 
            think of any good reason you might ever want to, tbh, other than perhaps debugging the SPACE attribute in xpGUI.e itself, and quite
            probably not spectacularly usefully even then.
