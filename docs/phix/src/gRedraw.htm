            There were <i>five</i> similar routines in pGUI, namely 
            <a href="IupRedraw.htm">IupRedraw</a>(), 
            <a href="IupRefresh.htm">IupRefresh</a>(), 
            <a href="IupRefreshChildren.htm">IupRefreshChildren</a>(), 
            <a href="IupUpdate.htm">IupUpdate</a>(), and
            <a href="IupUpdateChildren.htm">IupUpdateChildren</a>(), 
            and I always ended up experimenting until finding the one (particular combination that) did precisely what I wanted. <br>
            The flags parameter is, in time, intended to cover these three basic needs:<br>
            <ul>
            <li> do/don&rsquo;t bother to recalculate all the sizes and positions.</li>
            <li> resize (but don&rsquo;t reposition) just the one field, because it might now have longer text.</li>
            <li> do it now (if invoked from a busy-loop) or just queue the update.</li>
            </ul>
            Right now the routine is possibly a little more brutal than it needs to be, and might degrade performance
            a little bit, especially when updating a single status field several thousand times a second, but I&rsquo;ll 
            investigate that further if and when it becomes necessary, and not before. [In most cases a simple test on
            how long since the last update suffices, but something that stalls badly on (say) the 2237th and 9863rd 
            may quite possibly end up showing a random thing rather than the one it is actually struggling with, that
            is, should you have put that sort of time() test around your screen updates.]
