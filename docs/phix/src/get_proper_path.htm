            The root directory is only used when filepath is relative rather than absolute.
            If no root directory is provided, <a href="current_dir.htm">current_dir</a>() is used.

            Should work equally well for files and directories.
            <br>
            Of course the result is fairly meaningless if the the specified file or path 
            does not exist, but if you can open the input the same should always be true 
            for the output. The point of the routine is to create a consistent path/name 
            in terms of short->long filenames and actual upper/lower case, so that for
            example your application does not think that C:\PROGRA~2\PHIX\P.EXE and
            C:\Program Files (x86)\Phix\p.exe are two different files, in fact passing
            the former in should yield the latter out, as long as that "PROGRA~2" short 
            form matches what is shown when you run "dir /X".
