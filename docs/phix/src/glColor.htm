            While still supported on desktop/Phix, these routines have been coloured 
            <span class="illegal">illegal</span> to indicate they cannot be handled by 
            <a href="p2js.htm"><span class="pwap2js"><b>pwa/p2js</b></span></a>.

            red,blue,green,alpha: values in the range 0.0 (zero intensity) to 1.0 (full intensity).<br>
            For the alpha value, 0.0 means completely transparent and 1.0 means completely opaque.<br>
            Note that no validation of these values occurs, either in the Phix wrapper or the C code, however all color <br>
            components are clamped to the range [0,1] before they are interpolated or written into a color buffer.<br>
            <span class="illegal">glColor3</span> implicitly sets alpha to 1.0 (full intensity), unless the single parameter has 4 elements.

            The GL stores both a current single-valued color index and a current four-valued RGBA color. 
            <span class="illegal">glColor</span> sets a new four-valued RGBA color.

            The C interface specifies no less than 32 entry points, whereas the pGUI interface is simplified to just two entries. The f/d variants
            should map directly, but take special care with any b/i/s variants, if you ever see any of those - see Technicalia for details.
            <br>
            <br>
            The initial value for the current color is (1, 1, 1, 1).
            <br>
            <br>
            The current color can be updated at any time. In particular, <span class="illegal">glColor</span>() can be called between a call to 
            <a href="glBegin.htm"><span class="illegal">glBegin</span></a>() and the corresponding call to 
            <a href="glBegin.htm"><span class="illegal">glEnd</span></a>().
            <br>
            <br>
            Existing values can be retrieved via <a href="glGet.htm">glGet</a> with argument GL_CURRENT_COLOR or GL_RGBA_MODE.

          The C interface defines 32 entry points: glColor(3|4)((d|f)|[u](b|i|s))[v], For example glColor3b, glColor4fv - see the index for
          the full list, <i>all</i> marked incompatible, and all linked here.
          <br>
          <br>
          In light of the fact that I found no examples where they were actually used, and to simplify the wrapper, and this documentation, 
          there is currently no support for the [u](b|i|s)[v] variants. It would of course be trivial to add them should they ever be needed. 
          The original documentation said:<br>
          Unsigned integer color components, when specified, are linearly mapped to floating-point values such that the largest representable 
          value maps to 1.0 (full intensity), and 0 maps to 0.0 (zero intensity). <br>
          Signed integer color components, when specified, are linearly mapped to floating-point values such that the most positive representable 
          value maps to 1.0, and the most negative representable value maps to -1.0. (Note that this mapping does not convert 0 precisely to 0.0.) <br>
          Hence any b|i|s values will not work with glColor, which is a wrapper for glColor4d - ask for help if needed.<br>
          Floating-point values are mapped directly, and for pGUI there is no significant difference between the d and f variants, hence they have
          been merged (and internally use the "d" C functions).
          <br>
          <br>
          No C function name remains unscathed, all calls will require some manual translation to whichever of glColor or glColor3 is more natural.<br>
          Most commonly, the C function glColor3d should be changed to glColor (rather than glColor3), whereas in some legacy Euphoria code the 
          reverse happens to be true.
          <br>
          <br>
          Also, the [v] C functions are not currently wrapped, and are also coloured Incompatible. They would only be useful if there was some good 
          reason why you already had your byte/double/float/integer/short triplet/quadlet poked into some allocated memory.
