            Different GL implementations buffer commands in several different locations, including network buffers and the graphics accelerator itself. <br>
            glFlush empties all of these buffers, causing all issued commands to be executed as quickly as they are accepted by the actual rendering engine. <br>
            Though this execution may not be completed in any particular time period, it does complete in finite time.<br>
            Because any GL program might be executed over a network, or on an accelerator that buffers commands, all programs should call glFlush whenever 
            they count on having all of their previously issued commands completed. <br>
            For example, call glFlush before waiting for user input that depends on the generated image.
            <br>
            <br>
            glFlush can return at any time. It does not wait until the execution of all previously issued GL commands is complete.
            <br>

            <a href="glGetError.htm">GL_INVALID_OPERATION</a> is generated if glFlush() is executed between the execution of 
            <a href="glBegin.htm"><span class="illegal">glBegin</span></a>() and the corresponding execution of 
            <a href="glBegin.htm"><span class="illegal">glEnd</span></a>().
