            target: Specifies a symbolic constant indicating the behavior to be controlled. <br>
            GL_LINE_SMOOTH_HINT, GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH_HINT, GL_TEXTURE_COMPRESSION_HINT, and GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT are accepted.<br>
            mode: Specifies a symbolic constant indicating the desired behavior. GL_FASTEST, GL_NICEST, and GL_DONT_CARE are accepted.
          <br>
          <br>
            Certain aspects of GL behavior, when there is room for interpretation, can be controlled with hints. <br>
            A hint is specified with two arguments. <br>
            target is a symbolic constant indicating the behavior to be controlled, and <br>
            mode is another symbolic constant indicating the desired behavior. <br>
            The initial value for each target is GL_DONT_CARE. mode can be one of the following:<br>
            GL_FASTEST The most efficient option should be chosen.<br>
            GL_NICEST The most correct, or highest quality, option should be chosen.<br>
            GL_DONT_CARE No preference.
            <br>
            <br>
            Though the implementation aspects that can be hinted are well defined, the interpretation of the hints 
            depends on the implementation. <br>
            The hint aspects that can be specified with target, along with suggested semantics, are as follows:<br>
            GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT Indicates the accuracy of the derivative calculation for the GL shading 
            language fragment processing built-in functions: dFdx, dFdy, and fwidth.<br>
            GL_LINE_SMOOTH_HINT Indicates the sampling quality of antialiased lines. <br>
            If a larger filter function is applied, hinting GL_NICEST can result in more pixel fragments being generated during rasterization.<br>
            GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH_HINT Indicates the sampling quality of antialiased polygons. <br>
            Hinting GL_NICEST can result in more pixel fragments being generated during rasterization, if a larger filter function is applied.<br>
            GL_TEXTURE_COMPRESSION_HINT Indicates the quality and performance of the compressing texture images. <br>
            Hinting GL_FASTEST indicates that texture images should be compressed as quickly as possible, while GL_NICEST indicates that texture 
            images should be compressed with as little image quality loss as possible. <br>
            GL_NICEST should be selected if the texture is to be retrieved by glGetCompressedTexImage for reuse.
