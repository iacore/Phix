            specify material parameters for the lighting model
          <br>
          <br>
            face: Specifies which face or faces are being updated. Must be one of GL_FRONT, GL_BACK, or GL_FRONT_AND_BACK.<br>
            pname: Specifies the material parameter of the face or faces that is being updated. <br>
            Must be one of GL_AMBIENT, GL_DIFFUSE, GL_SPECULAR, GL_EMISSION, GL_SHININESS, GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE, or GL_COLOR_INDEXES.<br>
            v: Specifies the value or values that pname will be set to.
          <br>
          <br>
            glMaterial assigns values to material parameters. <br>
            There are two matched sets of material parameters. <br>
            One, the front-facing set, is used to shade points, lines, bitmaps, and all polygons (when two-sided lighting is disabled), 
            or just front-facing polygons (when two-sided lighting is enabled). <br>
            The other set, back-facing, is used to shade back-facing polygons only when two-sided lighting is enabled. <br>
            Refer to the glLightModel reference page for details concerning one- and two-sided lighting calculations.
            <br>
            <br>
            glMaterial takes three arguments. <br>
            The first, face, specifies whether the GL_FRONT materials, the GL_BACK materials, or both GL_FRONT_AND_BACK materials will be modified. <br>
            The second, pname, specifies which of several parameters in one or both sets will be modified. <br>
            The third, v, specifies what value or values will be assigned to the specified parameter.
            <br>
            <br>
            Material parameters are used in the lighting equation that is optionally applied to each vertex. <br>
            The equation is discussed in the glLightModel reference page. <br>
            The parameters that can be specified using glMaterial, and their interpretations by the lighting equation, are as follows:
            <br>
            <br>
            GL_AMBIENT v contains four integer or floating-point values that specify the ambient RGBA reflectance of the material. <br>
            Integer values are mapped linearly such that the most positive representable value maps to 1.0, and the most negative representable 
            value maps to -1.0.<br>
            Floating-point values are mapped directly. Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped. <br>
            The initial ambient reflectance for both front- and back-facing materials is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0).
            <br>
            <br>
            GL_DIFFUSE v contains four integer or floating-point values that specify the diffuse RGBA reflectance of the material. <br>
            Integer values are mapped linearly such that the most positive representable value maps to 1.0, and the most negative representable 
            value maps to -1.0.<br>
            Floating-point values are mapped directly. Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped. <br>
            The initial diffuse reflectance for both front- and back-facing materials is (0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0).
            <br>
            <br>
            GL_SPECULAR v contains four integer or floating-point values that specify the specular RGBA reflectance of the material. <br>
            Integer values are mapped linearly such that the most positive representable value maps to 1.0, and the most negative representable 
            value maps to -1.0.<br>
            Floating-point values are mapped directly. Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped. <br>
            The initial specular reflectance for both front- and back-facing materials is (0, 0, 0, 1).
            <br>
            <br>
            GL_EMISSION v contains four integer or floating-point values that specify the RGBA emitted light intensity of the material. <br>
            Integer values are mapped linearly such that the most positive representable value maps to 1.0, and the most negative representable 
            value maps to -1.0.<br>
            Floating-point values are mapped directly. Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped. <br>
            The initial emission intensity for both front- and back-facing materials is (0, 0, 0, 1).
            <br>
            <br>
            GL_SHININESS v is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies the RGBA specular exponent of the material. <br>
            Integer and floating-point values are mapped directly. Only values in the range 0 128 are accepted. <br>
            The initial specular exponent for both front- and back-facing materials is 0.
            <br>
            <br>
            GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE Equivalent to calling glMaterial twice with the same parameter values, once with GL_AMBIENT and once with GL_DIFFUSE.
            <br>
            <br>
            GL_COLOR_INDEXES v contains three integer or floating-point values specifying the color indices for ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting. <br>
            These three values, and GL_SHININESS, are the only material values used by the color index mode lighting equation. <br>
            Refer to the glLightModel reference page for a discussion of color index lighting.

            The material parameters can be updated at any time. <br>
            In particular, glMaterial can be called between a call to <a href="glBegin.htm"><span class="illegal">glBegin</span></a>() 
            and the corresponding call to <a href="glBegin.htm"><span class="illegal">glEnd</span></a>. <br>
            If only a single material parameter is to be changed per vertex, however, glColorMaterial is preferred over glMaterial (see glColorMaterial).
            <br>
            <br>
            While the ambient, diffuse, specular and emission material parameters all have alpha components, only the 
            diffuse alpha component is used in the lighting computation.
            <br>
            <br>
            The C functions glMaterialf(), glMaterialfv(), glMateriali(), and glMaterialiv() are coloured illegal and linked here: 
            they should all simply be replaced with glMaterial()
