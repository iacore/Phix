        I was just idly thinking about those "sequence of xxx" discussed eons ago.

#80 (0b0000)    seq         empty sequence (and/or "legacy behaviour")

#84 (0b0100)                string (1 byte per, see UTF the notes below)

#8A (0b1010)                sequence of 64-bit arrays (/illegal?)

        Note those are the [ref*4-1] bytes, not the 1..15 T_integer..T_object of the compiler.<br>
        So, first replace all #82 in the backend with #84 (should be no problems with doing that).<br>
        #8F is bascially what we have now, maybe try that (blanketwise) and see what probs arise.<br>
        UTF-8 and/or UTF-16-encoded binary strings are perfectly good enough, bar ws[i]<->#hhhh,<br>
        in other words it is no great hardship to convert to UTF-32 before anything char-by-char.<br>
        Existing opcodes opRepe etc should ||= type bytes, opSubse etc can avoid some refcounts.<br>
        Obviously opMkSq should also collect element types, and repeat() shd be a smidge easier.<br>
        Even better savings occur inline: types shd be mirrored in the new parse tree localtypes.<br>
        A new array type is required to use the new #82/#86, existing opcodes should just crash.<br>
        There should also be a new float64|128 type for dealing with array elements, probably.<br>
        If parameters (etc) of that type are allowed, they would also have to be reference types.<br>
        Obviously if you box and unbox into an atom type there will just be no performance gains.<br>
        I assume there is simply no point trying to implement an array of 80-bit floats, anyway.<br>
        The ability to take or replace slices of arrays is probably just simply not worthwhile.<br>
        Allowing explicit "sequence of" in the source code is a niceity, and not a necessity, and<br>
        it would probably be best to introduce a new implicit udt-style routine to enforce that.<br>
        The handling of opTchk/T_seq within pilx86.e might not actually even need <i>any</i> tweaks.
        <br>
        <br>
        [1] standard 4/8 bytes per element, can be nested refs except o/c for "of integer".<br>
        *,** : good optimisations available with these<br>
        *** : lesser optimisations (on the localtypes of extracted elements)<br>
        Note that any nested sequences have the same potential optimisations available to them.<br>
        There is probably very little gain for "sequence of arrays" over "sequence of sequence"<br>
