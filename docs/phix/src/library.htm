      <h1 class="title">Library Routines</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
         A large number of library routines are provided. Some are written in low-level inline assembly,
         and some are written hll. Most are automatically included as and when needed, but some require
         an explicit include statement before they can be used. In the latter case, the appropriate 
         include file is noted in the "Syntax" part of the description. Of course an include file need 
         only be included once in your program. The editor displays in magenta those routines that are 
         built into the interpreter, and require no include file. You can override the definition
         of these built-in routines by defining your own routine with the same name.
         You will get a suppressible warning if you do this.

         To indicate what kind of
       <b>object</b> may be passed in and returned, the following prefixes are used:

         Some routines are only available on one or two of the three platforms. 
         This is noted with "Platform: WINDOWS" or "Platform: Linux" in the description of the routine, and with (WINDOWS) or (Linux) in some other places.
       <br>
       <br>
         A run-time error message will usually result if an illegal argument value
         is passed to any of these routines.
