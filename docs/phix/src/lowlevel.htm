      <h1 class="title">Low level bug tips</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
        Tips for resolving low-level bugs in phix:
        <br>
        <br>
        There may be problems that go way beyond anything the standard ex.err, trace(), and profile() 
        mechanisms can help you with, or indeed affect the latter trio directly: lower-level is needed,
        at least until whichever of those three failed is fit and well again.
        <br>
        <br>
        Obviously this is a last resort, feel free to chuck real nasties into my lap and stand well back.
        <br>
        <br>
        Likewise this is not something you can jump into on day one; it needs a basic understanding of the
        whole VM, and the ability to understand the whole of any list.asm files that you produce.
        <br>
        <br>
        An intermediate level problem is resolving a bad <a href="html/glossary.htm#era">era</a>: often 
        this can be resolved by careful examination of the specific builtins\VM file getting it wrong, and
        perhaps a little bit of trial and error.
        <br>
        <br>
        For an entry level low-level problem, might I suggest scouring a list.asm to find something that you 
        could improve on, for example "if n&lt;length(s)" loads everything into registers before a cmp reg,reg 
        whereas I am pretty sure a cmp reg,[ebx+reg*4-12] would help shave something off. Just bear in mind
        that sometimes things are done the long/hard/convoluted way in order to be more helpful when things
        go wrong, so consider adding a few more tests to test/terror.exw *before* starting anything else.
        <br>
        <br>
        If possible, reproduce the problem using "p -d test" and running test.exe. Typically I will spend
        quite some time reducing the program to the absolute bare bones, eg demo\arwendemo\bug003.exw is
        a severely hacked copy of demo\arwendemo\demo_toolbar.exw and was created the hard way: by copying
        the whole of arwen.ew and half a dozen other includes into bug003.exw, removing all the "global",
        and deleting all the not used bits. The program has to be re-tested at every step, usually I have
        to undo something that fixed it, and yes, it takes days, not hours. Once I have made life as easy 
        as possible, and assuming close examination of the last changes in the list.asm revealed nothing,
        I run the failing program under OllyDbg, regularly toggling back to said list.asm.
        <br>
        <br>
        If the problem only occurs under "p test", a couple of extra steps are required: You may want or
        need a listing of the compiler itself, especially the VM parts that get re-used, in which case 
        run "p -d p" and copy the resulting list.asm to (say) p.asm. Then create another listing file 
        (list.asm) using "p -d! test". Find the "call ecx" (or "call rcx") in p.exw/main() and trap on
        that in OllyDbg (or FDBG). Single-step and make a note of the address it calls. Compare that 
        with the top of your list.asm; the difference must be (manually) applied to all code addresses.
        That covers the code section (CSvaddr), it may be that you need a similar difference to cover 
        the data section (DSvaddr), both of which are fixed via the "p -d test" route. The easiest way 
        to calculate the DSvaddr offset is by looking at any variable reference in the list.asm and then
        compare it with the equivalent reference once you have found the precise location of the code 
        you are actually debugging.
        <br>
        <br>
        However the heap can also experience motion, and for that I can only recommend looking at the
        value of pGtcb, which is at least in a static location, found by looking in that p.asm, whether 
        running via "p -d test" or "p test". If your program allocates multiple blocks or use threads,
        that may prove a fair bit more difficult.
        <br>
        <br>
        The reason these things move (at least on windows 7) is that every time you allocate some memory,
        the operating system locates it somewhere different. I *GUESS* it is either some kind of screen
        saver for memory cells (ie preventing damage by always using the same parts) or more likely it
        improves compatibility of some some application(s) that re-use memory (just) after it has been
        freed, and further they might have been getting away with that an awful lot more on previous
        versions of Windows, and therefore this has been introduced so that fewer people think the new 
        version of Windows sucks when the real culrit is some bug-ridden application they use. Anyway,
        it is a cross you must bear at the sharp end, and I trust it is now clear that "p -d test" is
        at least three times easier than "p test" when attempting low-level debugging.
