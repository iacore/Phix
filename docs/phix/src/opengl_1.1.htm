        These routines are not supported on WebGL. 
        <br>
        <br>
        While still supported on desktop/Phix, many routines have been coloured 
        <span class="illegal">illegal</span> to indicate they cannot be handled by 
        <a href="p2js.htm"><span class="pwap2js"><b>pwa/p2js</b></span></a>. (for now...)

        There is however a glsim.js (google it) that offers some hope, albeit weighing in at 133K and "not for serious work".<br>
        My attempts to use that failed because it does not define either glShadeModel() or glGenLists(), plus I have no plans 
        to attempt anything at all regarding "include glu.e", which obviously also won&rsquo;t work under pwa/p2js.<br>
        FWIW there are some notes in demo\pGUI\gears.exw detailing that effort - in short remove the "without jabvascript_semantics",
        then transpile, then edit the test.htm it generated by hand, then try running/debugging it in the browser.<br>
        I have not attempted any of the samples that come with that glsim.js, or looked very hard for any similar alternatives.

<!-- trying to apply glsim.js manually was a bust...
