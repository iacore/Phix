        The following libraries are technically not part of Phix, but are included in the standard distribution.
        <br>
        <br>
        Since a plain alpabetical list was starting to get out of hand, these have been reorganised into several
        ad-hoc subgroups:
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="general.htm">general</a> - maths, formatting, regex, dates, testing, etc.<br>
        <a href="userinterface.htm">GUI</a> - graphical user interfaces, and a simple beep function.<br>
        <a href="internet.htm">internet</a> - internet access and file format conversion.<br>
        <a href="programming.htm">programming</a> - specifically programming-related aids.<br>
        <a href="storage.htm">storage</a> - data indexing and storage solutions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Suggestions for any alternative names and/or groupings to the above five would be welcome.
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="utilities.htm">utilites</a> (currently this just holds some dumped text)<br>
        <a href="deprecated.htm">deprecated</a> - no plans to deliberately cripple anything, though.<br>
        <br>
