            Converts a string representation of a JSON object into an internal form suitable for further processing.
            <br>
            <br>
            s: should contain a valid string representation of a JSON object.
            <br>
            <br>
            The result of parsing a JSON string is as follows:
            <ul>
            <li>Numbers and Strings (without quotes) are held natively</li>
            <li>An object is held as a sequence with a first element of -1 (JSON_OBJECT), 
                         and the rest pairs, the first of which is a string and the 
                         second any of these types.</li>
            <li>An array is held as a sequence with a first element of -2 (JSON_ARRAY),
                        and the rest any of these types.</li>
            <li>A keyword is held as a sequence with a first element of -3 (JSON_KEYWORD),
                         and one of the strings "true", "false", or "null".</li>
            </ul>
            Note the subscript of the first pair in an object, and element in an array, is always [2].
            <br>

            For some valid (and invalid) JSON examples, see demo\rosetta\JSON.exw.
            <br>
            <br>
            Attempts to parse an invalid JSON string yield {JSON_INVALID}, ie {-4}.
