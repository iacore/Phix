      <h1 class="title">sha256</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
        The file builtins/sha256.e (not an autoinclude) contains a simple sha256() implementation.<br>
        There is a matching hand-crafted/selected pwa/builtins/sha256.js for use with 
        <a href="p2js.htm"><span class="pwap2js"><b>pwa/p2js</b></span></a>.
        <br>

        I am not the best person to ask about any security considerations; one thing I can say is the 
        output seems to match that of other implementations. Another thing I have read and would agree 
        with is that plain text over https is undeniably far <i>more</i> secure than client-side hashing 
        and sending over plain http, but I have no authority to back up even such common sense claims.
        Likewise it would be total lunacy to publish sensitive keys in client-side JavaScript, however 
        well you might think they are hidden, at least that is in my unqualified opinion.
        It is only included because many web/rest api demand the use of SHA-256, then again they might
        well be advising <i>against</i> invocation of their api from client-side JavaScript.

            <dl><dt>
            <b>sha256</b>(string msg)   -- returns a secure 32-byte hash of msg.
            </dt></dl>
          </td></tr>

        <br>
        Note that desktop/Phix accepts/requires/returns a (binary) string msg/result, whereas pwa/p2js 
        returns a sequence of bytes and accepts a string/sequence argument, which is only ever going to 
        matter (in a typeless language) if it is explicitly tested for.
        <br>
        <br>
        Every JavaScript implementation I could find yielded a human-readable hex string, and the one 
        I finally settled on was no exception, but I modififed it to yield raw binary. 
        Such strings are/were great for tests, and demos, and passing on to a web/rest api, but are a 
        real hindrance to any kind of double-hashing, which includes all hmac and blockchain uses. 
        At the moment there is no official way to convert the binary into such a human readable string 
        but I could probably dig something up easily enough should it ever be needed.
