        You may very well manage just fine with only ever using 
        <a href="sqlite3_exec.htm">sqlite3_exec</a>() and
        <a href="sqlite3_get_table.htm">sqlite3_get_table</a>(),
        or even just one of those, <br>
        however SQLite contains many more advanced features you may wish to take advantage of.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have copied many details straight from the SQLite website. <br>
        The <a href="sqlite3_lang.htm">SQL As Understood By SQLite</a> documents are <i>very</i> thorough, hence the much 
        simpler <a href="SQLcheat.htm">cheat sheet</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Of course the main point of doing all this is just to make these documents easily searchable, and more readily to hand.
