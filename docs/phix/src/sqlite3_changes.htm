            The sqlite3_changes() function returns the number of database rows that were changed (or inserted or deleted) by 
            the most recently completed INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.<br>
            Only changes that are directly specified by the INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement are counted.<br>
            Auxiliary changes caused by triggers are not counted.<br>
            Use the sqlite3_total_changes() function to find the total number of changes including changes caused by triggers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Within the body of a trigger, the sqlite3_changes() function does work to report the number of rows that were changed 
            for the most recently completed INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement within the trigger body.
            <br>
            <br>
            The sqlite3_total_changes() function returns the total number of database rows that have be modified, inserted, or 
            deleted since the database connection was created using <a href="sqlite3_open.htm">sqlite3_open</a>().<br>
            All changes are counted, including changes by triggers and changes to TEMP and auxiliary databases.<br>
            Except, changes to the SQLITE_MASTER table (caused by statements such as CREATE TABLE) are not counted.<br>
            Nor are changes counted when an entire table is deleted using DROP TABLE.
            <br>
            <br>
            SQLite implements the command "DELETE FROM table" without a WHERE clause by dropping and recreating the table.<br>
            (This is much faster than going through and deleting individual elements form the table.) <br>
            Because of this optimization, the change count for "DELETE FROM table" will be zero regardless of the number of elements 
            that were originally in the table.<br>
            To get an accurate count of the number of rows deleted, use "DELETE FROM table WHERE 1" instead.
