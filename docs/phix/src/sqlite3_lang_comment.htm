        Comments are not SQL commands, but can occur within the text of
        SQL queries passed to <a href="sqlite3_prepare.htm">sqlite3_prepare()</a> and related interfaces.
        Comments are treated as whitespace by the parser.
        Comments can begin anywhere whitespace 
        can be found, including inside expressions that span multiple lines.
       </p>
       <p>
        SQL comments begin with two consecutive "-" characters (ASCII 0x2d)
        and extend up to and including the next newline character (ASCII 0x0a)
        or until the end of input, whichever comes first.
       </p>
       <p>
        C-style comments begin
        with "/*" and extend up to and including the next "*/" character pair
        or until the end of input, whichever comes first.  C-style comments
        can span multiple lines.
       </p>
       <p>
        Comments can appear anywhere whitespace can occur,
        including inside expressions and in the middle of other SQL statements.
        Comments do not nest.
