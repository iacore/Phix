      <div id="mainSection">
       <p><b><a href="sqlite3_syntaxdiagrams.htm#drop-table-stmt">drop-table-stmt:</a></b>
        <button id='x1073' onclick='hideorshow("x1073","x1074")'>hide</button>
       </p>
       <div id='x1074' class='imgcontainer'>

       <p>The DROP TABLE statement removes a table added with the
        <a href="sqlite3_lang_createtable.htm">CREATE TABLE</a> statement.  The name specified is the
        table name.  The dropped table is completely removed from the database 
        schema and the disk file.  The table can not be recovered.  
        All indices and triggers
        associated with the table are also deleted.
       </p>
       <p>The optional IF EXISTS clause suppresses the error that would normally
        result if the table does not exist.
       </p>
       <p>If <a href="sqlite3_foreignkeys.htm">foreign key constraints</a> are enabled, a DROP TABLE command performs an
        implicit <a href="sqlite3_lang_delete.htm">DELETE FROM</a> command before removing the
        table from the database schema. Any triggers attached to the table are
        dropped from the database schema before the implicit DELETE FROM
        is executed, so this cannot cause any triggers to fire. By contrast, an
        implicit DELETE FROM does cause any configured
        <a href="sqlite3_foreignkeys.htm#fk_actions">foreign key actions</a> to take place. 
        If the implicit DELETE FROM executed
        as part of a DROP TABLE command violates any immediate foreign key constraints,
        an error is returned and the table is not dropped. If 
        the implicit DELETE FROM causes any 
        deferred foreign key constraints to be violated, and the violations still
        exist when the transaction is committed, an error is returned at the time
        of commit.
