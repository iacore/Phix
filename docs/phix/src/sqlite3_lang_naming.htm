      <h1 class="title">Database Object Name Resolution</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
       <p>
        In SQLite, a database object (a table, index, trigger or view) is identified
        by the name of the object and the name of the database that it resides in. 
        Database objects may reside in the main database, the temp database, or in
        an <a href="sqlite3_lang_attach.htm">attached database</a>.
       </p>
       <p>
        The syntax of the <a href="sqlite3_lang_droptable.htm">DROP TABLE</a>, 
        <a href="sqlite3_lang_dropindex.htm">DROP INDEX</a>, 
        <a href="sqlite3_lang_dropview.htm">DROP VIEW</a>, 
        <a href="sqlite3_lang_droptrigger.htm">DROP TRIGGER</a>,
        <a href="sqlite3_lang_reindex.htm">REINDEX</a>, 
        <a href="sqlite3_lang_altertable.htm">ALTER TABLE</a> and many other commands all permit the user to
        specify a database object either by its name alone, or by a combination of
        its name and the name of its database. If no database is specified as part
        of the object reference, then SQLite searches the main, temp and all attached
        databases for an object with a matching name. The temp database is searched
        first, followed by the main database, followed all attached databases in the
        order that they were attached. The reference resolves to the first match
        found. For example:
       </p>

    <pre>
          /* Add a table named 't1' to the temp, main and an attached database */
          ATTACH 'file.db' AS aux;
          CREATE TABLE t1(x, y);
          CREATE TEMP TABLE t1(x, y);
          CREATE TABLE aux.t1(x, y);

          DROP TABLE t1;         /* Drop table in temp database */
          DROP TABLE t1;         /* Drop table in main database */
          DROP TABLE t1;         /* Drop table in aux database */
    </pre>
       <p>
        If a schema name is specified as part of an object reference, it must be
        either "main", or "temp" or the schema-name of an attached database.
        Like other SQL identifiers, schema names are case-insensitive.
        If a schema name is specified, then only that one schema is searched for
        the named object.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most object references may only resolve to a specific type of object (for
        example a reference that is part of a DROP TABLE statement may only resolve
        to a table object, not an index, trigger or view). However in some contexts 
        (e.g. <a href="sqlite3_lang_reindex.htm">REINDEX</a>) an object reference may be resolve to more than one type
        of object. When searching database schemas for a named object, objects of
        types that cannot be used in the context of the reference are always 
        ignored.
