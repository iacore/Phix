      <h1 class="title">SQL Features That SQLite Does Not Implement</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
       <p>
        SQLite implements most of the common features of SQL.
        Rather than try to list all the features of SQL that SQLite does
        support, it is much easier to list those that it does not.
        Unsupported features of SQL are shown below.
       </p>
       <table cellpadding="10">
        <tr>
         <td valign="top"><b>
          <nobr>RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOIN</nobr></b>
         </td>
         <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
         <td valign="top">
          LEFT OUTER JOIN is implemented, but not RIGHT OUTER JOIN or FULL OUTER JOIN.<br>
          <small>[PL: note that database.e has never had a JOIN of <i>any</i> kind, and apparently no-one has missed it.]</small>
         </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td valign="top"><b>
          <nobr>Complete ALTER TABLE support</nobr></b>
         </td>
         <td width="10">&nbsp;
         </td>
         <td valign="top">
          Only the RENAME TABLE and ADD COLUMN variants of the 
          ALTER TABLE command are supported.  Other kinds of ALTER TABLE operations
          such as
          DROP COLUMN, ALTER COLUMN, ADD CONSTRAINT, and so forth are omitted.
         </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td valign="top"><b>
          <nobr>Complete trigger support</nobr></b>
         </td>
         <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
         <td valign="top">
          FOR EACH ROW triggers are supported but not FOR EACH STATEMENT
          triggers.
         </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td valign="top"><b>
          <nobr>Writing to VIEWs</nobr></b>
         </td>
         <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
         <td valign="top">
          VIEWs in SQLite are read-only.  You may not execute a DELETE, INSERT, or
          UPDATE statement on a view. But you can create a trigger
          that fires on an attempt to DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE a view and do
          what you need in the body of the trigger.
         </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td valign="top"><b>
          <nobr>GRANT and REVOKE</nobr></b>
         </td>
         <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
         <td valign="top">
          Since SQLite reads and writes an ordinary disk file, the
          only access permissions that can be applied are the normal
          file access permissions of the underlying operating system.
          The GRANT and REVOKE commands commonly found on client/server
          RDBMSes are not implemented because they would be meaningless
          for an embedded database engine.
