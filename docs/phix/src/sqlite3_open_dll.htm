            Optional. Normally pSQLite.e attempts to open the dll from the application or Phix\demo\pSQLite\ directory, and terminates fatally on error.
            <br>
            <br>
            Use this function to override that behaviour, for instance if you are distributing a dll with a pre-compiled application,
            especially when in a subdirectory or with renamed 32/64-bit copies, or when testing/comparing different versions.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can give a different error message, or even try automatically downloading one 
            (using <a href="curl_easy_perform.htm#curl_easy_get_file">curl_easy_get_file</a>() or similar) and retry.<br>
            Obviously leaving dll_name as "" tests whether it can open the standard file/directory as mentioned above.
            <br>
            <br>
            Note that if a dll has already been successfully opened, this will simply return true, and in that case it also completely 
            ignores anything specified in dll_name. Likewise you can only open one dll per run, so when testing/comparing different 
            versions, the test program would need to be shut down and restarted between each, though of course you could always use
            <a href="system_exec.htm">system_exec</a>() and <a href="ipc.htm">ipc</a> or similar to automate things and collect data
            from several different runs of a sub-program.
            <br>
            <br>
            Returns true on success, false otherwise.
