          <br>
            When your program terminates, the last color that you selected
             and actually printed on the screen will remain in effect.
             Thus you may have to print something, maybe just '\n', in
             WHITE to restore white text, especially if you are at the
             bottom line of the screen, ready to scroll up.

            Note that the constants were copied verbatim from Euphoria, and differ between Windows and Linux. Hence while
            (eg) text_color(BLUE) will be consistent between those platforms, any programs which loop 0..15, such as
            demo/rosetta/Coloured_text.exw, are likely to look fairly different. Ideally I might choose to use consistent
            numbers instead, with a little mapping at the point of use, but then some programs such as the one mentioned
            above, or perhaps more importantly some legacy code you are trying to convert, c/would behave differently on
            Euphoria and Phix.
