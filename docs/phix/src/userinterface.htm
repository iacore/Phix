        Libraries and components concerned with graphical user interfaces:

       <br>
        <a href="beep.htm">beep</a> - a (somewhat painfully) simple beep procedure (console or gui).<br>
        <a href="librsvg.htm">librsvg</a> - [draft] svg (scaleable vector graphics) handling.<br>
        <a href="pGUI.htm">pGUI</a> - The Phix portable Graphical User Interface - 32/64 bit, Windows/Linux compatible.<br>
        <a href="xpGUI.htm">xpGUI</a> - The Phix Cross Platform Graphical User Interface - 32/64 bit, Windows/Linux/p2js/ARM compatible.<br>
        <br>
        xpGUI is a planned replacement for pGUI, that will not depend on IUP and should therefore simplify installation on Linux, get rid
        of a couple of (Windows) niggles, and hopefully will/should also work on a Raspberry Pi (but that&rsquo;s all quite some way off).
