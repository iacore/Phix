         These special statements affect the way that Phix
         translates your program into internal form. They are not meant to
         change the logic of your program, but they may affect the diagnostic
         information that you get from running your program.
         See <a href="debugging.htm">Debugging and Profiling</a> for more information.

           <b>with</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         This turns <b>on</b> one of the options: <b>profile</b>, <b>profile_time</b>, 
         <b>trace</b>, <b>warning</b> or <b>type_check</b>.
         Options <b>warning</b> and <b>type_check</b> are initially on, while
         <b>profile</b>, <b>profile_time</b> and <b>trace</b> are initially off.
        </dd>
       </dl>
         Any warnings that are issued will appear on your screen after your
         program has finished execution. Warnings indicate very minor problems.
         A warning will never stop your program from executing.

<!--
        <b>Note</b>: Phix ships "<b>with <i>without warning</i> disabled</b>", since it is far easier to get code written for Euphoria to work
        on Phix when the compiler is allowed to issue a few helpful warnings. However, I needed without warning for "p -test", and if you feel the
        need to suppress warnings in your project, simply modify pmain.e/DoWithOptions() such that the "elsif testall then" branch always happens.
        And obviously rebuild Phix, which should take less than fifteen seconds (run "p -c p"/"./phix -c p").
        <br>
        <br>
-->
        There was once also a special <b>with</b> <i>number</i> option.
        This is no longer used and can safely be deleted.
       <br>
       <br>
<!--
        You can select any combination of settings, and you can change the settings,
        but the changes must occur
        <b>
         <i>between</i>
        </b> subroutines, not
        within a subroutine. The only exception is that you can only turn on one
        type of profiling for a given run of your program.
-->
        You may only enable either profile or profile_time, but not both, for a given run of your program.<br>
        Unlike Euphoria, settings can be changed mid-routine.
       <br>
       <br>
        Note that "without warning strict" is an Euphoria thing; Phix simply ignores the "strict", but complains should any of the other 17 
        or so complex warning settings of Euphoria be encountered. Phix also simply ignores attempts to set indirect_includes and inline, 
        but currently displays an error for ifdef tags (with/without define).
       <br>
       <br>
        Phix also allows <b>with/without debug</b> and (deprecated, see <a href="format.htm">format</a>) <b>console/gui</b>.
       <br>
       <br>
        An
        <b>included file</b> inherits the <b>with/without</b> settings in effect at the point where it is included.
        An included file can change these settings, but they will revert back to their original state at the end of the included file.
        For instance, an included file might turn off warnings for itself and (initially) for any files that it includes,
        but this will not turn off warnings for the main file.
