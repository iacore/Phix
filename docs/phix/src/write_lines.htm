            The filename parameter can be a string, in which case the file is opened and closed by this
            routine, or an integer from a previous call to <a href="open.htm">open</a>(), in which case
            it is not closed by this routine, and will/may append content, depending on the mode with
            which it was opened and any intervening activity, such as <a href="puts.htm">puts</a>() or 
            <a href="seek.htm">seek</a>().<br>
            The lines parameter can be a single string or a sequence of strings.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the file cannot be opened, -1 is returned, with +1 indicating success.

            Whereas Euphoria may sometimes <a href="and_bits.htm">and_bits</a>(char,#FF), this rejects any lines[i] 
            which is not a string (unless lines itself is a string), and makes no attempt (not even implicitly) to 
            coerce a dword-sequence back into a string, either top-level or nested - should you need that you will
            have to make a copy and relax the interval validation.

            Whilst perfectly suited to writing UTF-8 files, this routine is not capable of writing UTF-16 or UTF-32,
            except perhaps as carefully pre-composed byte-strings (including any required BOM header).
