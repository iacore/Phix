-- ===========

--  totally OTT, perhaps, but certainly proves the compiler won't clobber
--  you for one tiny inconsistency in filenames/paths.
--  Naturally, "p -d -nodiag t17" should yield a filetable like this:
--      symtab[17]:{{3, "t17incV.exw"}, {4, "once.e"}}
--  "c:" tests commented out for release, so that they will run anywhere.
