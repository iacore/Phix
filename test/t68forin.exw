--  Test the new for..in construct

--  Many of the failing tests have to be run manually...
--  maybe they should be part of test/terror.exw, then again
--  maybe something new is needed for pwa/p2js anyway... then
--  again compilation errors were simply never the big deal.
--  We should do everything we can with try/catch though...
